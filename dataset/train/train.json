The diameter of the caster-wheels are a bit larger than the diameter of the rod, but both diameters are much smaller than the length of the rod. The gravitational acceleration is $g$.

Instead of analyzing the propagation of the light, one may study the motion of a mass point that moves along the path of the light ray, driven by a conservative force. The potential energy of the conservative force field depends on the distribution the refractive index.

We shall use this fact in the following.  We're going to rephrase the problem: we're going to calculate the force required to move the tube constantly in the field of the fixed magnet with a velocity $v$ : this is valid because of the equivalence of inertial systems (the system of the tube and the system of the magnet falling by $v$ ) and Newton's 3rd law, thus the force calculated this way is the same as the braking force exerted by the tube on the magnet.  In order to calculate this force, let's detach the tube in small rings of thickness $\\mathrm{d} z$. In such a ring of distance $z$ from the centre of the ball, the magnetic field induces an EMF of $ U(z)=B_{\\perp}(z) \\ell v $ due to Neumann's law, where $\\ell$ is the length of the ring $\\ell=2 a \\pi$ and $B_{\\perp}$ is the radial component of the field of the dipole (the field has no tangential component due to symmetry and Amp\u00e8re's law; the tube-longitudinal component of the field doesn't induce any EMF since it's parallel to $v$ ). The resistance of the ring is $ R=\\rho \\frac{\\ell}{A}=\\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\frac{\\ell}{\\Delta \\cdot \\mathrm{d} z} $ where $A$ is the area of the cross-section of the ring; the current flowing in this ring is then $ \\mathrm{d} I(z)=\\frac{U(z)}{R}=\\sigma \\Delta B_{\\perp}(z) v \\mathrm{~d} z ; $ the Joule power dissipated by this ring is then $ \\mathrm{d} P(z)=U(z) \\mathrm{d} I(z)=\\sigma \\Delta B_{\\perp}^2(z) v^2 \\cdot 2 a \\pi \\mathrm{d} z . $  The total power dissipated by the tube is then $ P=\\int_{z=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d} P(z)=\\sigma \\Delta v^2 \\cdot 2 a \\pi \\int_{z=-\\infty}^{\\infty} B_{\\perp}^2(z) \\mathrm{d} z . $  Here, we shall use that the magnetic field of a dipole can be expressed as $ \\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r})=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{m}}{r^3}+\\frac{3(\\mathbf{m} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) \\mathbf{r}}{r^5}\\right), $ the radial component of which in a point of axial distance $z$ and radial distance $a$ from the dipole is $ B_{\\perp}(z)=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{3 m \\cdot z a}{r^5}=\\frac{3 \\mu_0 m}{4 \\pi} \\frac{z a}{\\left(z^2+a^2\\right)^{5 / 2}}=\\frac{3 \\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{4 \\pi}{3} a^3 M_0 \\frac{z a}{\\left(z^2+a^2\\right)^{5 / 2}}=\\mu_0 M_0 a^4 \\cdot \\frac{z}{\\left(z^2+a^2\\right)^{5 / 2}} ; $ substituting this into the expression of $P$ gives $   P=\\sigma \\Delta v^2 \\cdot 2 a \\pi \\cdot \\mu_0^2 M_0^2 a^8 \\int_{z=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^2 \\mathrm{~d} z}{\\left(z^2+a^2\\right)^5}=2 \\pi \\mu_0^2 \\sigma \\Delta M_0^2 a^9 v^2 \\int_{\\alpha=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{a^2 \\alpha^2 \\cdot a \\mathrm{~d} \\alpha}{a^{10}\\left(\\alpha^2+1\\right)^5}= \\\\  =2 \\pi \\mu_0^2 \\sigma \\Delta M_0^2 a^2 v^2 \\int_{\\alpha=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^2 \\mathrm{~d} \\alpha}{\\left(1+\\alpha^2\\right)^5} .  $ (We have used the substitution $z=\\alpha a$ in order to make the integral dimensionless.) It can be found (by using mathematical programs or by looking up the antiderivative in an integral table) that the improper integral exists and its value is $\\frac{5 \\pi}{128}$; consequently, the value of the power is $ P=2 \\pi \\mu_0^2 \\sigma \\Delta M_0^2 a^2 v^2 \\cdot \\frac{5 \\pi}{128}=\\frac{5 \\pi^2}{64} \\mu_0^2 \\sigma \\Delta M_0^2 a^2 v^2 $ This power is dissipated by the tube: if we want to maintain the velocity, this power should be entered into the system mechanically. It is well-known, that the mechanical power can be calculated as $P=F v$ (obviously, the force must be parallel to the velocity), consequently the required force is $ F=\\frac{P}{v}=\\frac{5 \\pi^2}{64} \\mu_0^2 \\sigma \\Delta M_0^2 a^2 v . $  According to the Newton equation, this force brakes the tube with respect to the magnet (the total force acting on a uniformly moving body must be zero); and due to Newton's 3rd law, this force brakes the magnet with respect to the tube.

Let the impulse of the incident photon be $\\left(p_x, p_y\\right)$ in this frame (the mirror moves in the $-x$ direction, $+y$ direction points \"upwards\"). Then the impulse of the photon reflected from the standing mirror is $\\left(-p_x, p_y\\right)$ as the energy of the photon doesn't change and the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection (this is well-known for standing mirrors). The energy of both photons is $W=\\sqrt{p_x^2+p_y^2}$. Now we go back to the rest frame: as the mirror moves with $v$ to $-x$ in this frame, the velocity of this frame is $v$ to the $+x$ direction compared to the mirror frame. We can use the Lorentz transformation on the energy-impulse four-vector to get the parameters of the incident and the reflected photon in the rest frame. Due to the Lorentz transformation, the $y$-components of the incident and the reflected photons' impulse are $p_y$; the energy of the photons can be calculated as: $ W_i=\\frac{W-p_x v}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}} ; \\quad W_r=\\frac{W-\\left(-p_x\\right) v}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}}=\\frac{W+p_x v}{\\sqrt{1-v^2}} $  Since the energy and the magnitude of the impulse of a photon is the same (as $c=1$ ), $\\sin \\alpha=\\frac{p_y}{W_i}$ and $\\sin \\beta=\\frac{p_y}{W_r}$.

It is easily shown that the size of the image formed on the screen of the camera, for an object of size $H$ at a distance $L$ from the camera, is given by $h=H f / L$. Suppose now that the camera is approaching the object at a relativistic speed $v$ while rapidly taking a photograph; assume the distance between the camera and the object is still $L$.

        "solution": "B. (a) Let's examine the situation from the rest frame of the camera. Due to Lorentz contraction, the distance of the object to the camera is $L^{\\prime}=L \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$, whilst its height does not change: $H^{\\prime}=H$. However, the camera shows the image of the object that was in a distance $L_1$ from it: since this point, the distance covered by the light $c t$, while that of the object is $v t$ : their difference is $c t-v t=L^{\\prime}$, thus $t=\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{c-v}$, so $L_1=c t=\\frac{L^{\\prime}}{1-v / c}=L \\sqrt{\\frac{1+v / c}{1-v / c}}=L \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$. This is the distance of the object to the camera that can be seen at the place of the camera: the image will be formed as if the object were in a distance of $L_1$. Using the formula for image height gives the height as $h^{\\prime}=\\frac{H^{\\prime} f}{L_1}=\\frac{H f}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}}=h \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}}$. Thus the image will be smaller compared to the camera in rest. (b) The rate of variation is $\\dot{h}^{\\prime}$. We're going to calculate this rate in the camera frame: due to Lorentz dilatation, the eigentimespan can be calculated from the inertial timespan as $\\mathrm{d} t^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{d} t \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$, thus $ \\dot{h^{\\prime}}=H f \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}}\\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)=H f \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}} \\frac{-\\dot{L}}{L^2}=\\frac{H f}{L^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}} \\frac{v \\mathrm{~d} t}{\\mathrm{~d} t \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\\frac{H f v}{L^2} \\frac{1}{1+v / c} . $ (During an inertial timespan $\\mathrm{d} t$, the object and the camera get closer by $v \\mathrm{~d} t$.)

        "solution": "We examine the process from the camera rest frame. The camera-mirror distance in this frame is $L_1=L \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$. As the mirror approaches the camera with $v$, the distance between the camera and the mirror was $L_2=\\frac{L_1}{1-v / c}=L \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$ when the light recorded at the examined moment was reflected (to conclude this, we can use the same ideas as in 1. B. (a)).  Now we determine the parameters of the virtual image at this point. Since the perpendicularly incoming rays are reflected perpendicularly, the image points will be at the same vertical height as the respective points of the camera: this causes that the width of the camera and its mirror image is the same. Now check a light ray that comes from a point of the camera to the mirror covering a distance $L_2$ horizontally and $x \\ll L_2$ vertically: if the distance of the image is $L_3$, the tangent of the angle of incidence and reflection is $\\tan \\alpha=\\frac{x}{L_2}, \\tan \\beta=\\frac{x}{L_3}$; since $x$ is small, $\\tan \\alpha=\\alpha$ and $\\tan \\beta=\\beta$ can be used. Using the small angle limit for the relativistic mirror gives $\\frac{c+v}{c-v}=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}=\\frac{\\tan \\alpha}{\\tan \\beta}=\\frac{x / L_2}{x / L_3}=\\frac{L_3}{L_2}$, thus $L_3=L_2 \\frac{c+v}{c-v}$. The size of the image is $D$ while its distance from the mirror is $L_3$.  Consequently, the camera records an image of width $D$ in an effective distance $L^{\\prime}=L_2+L_3=$ $L_2\\left(1+\\frac{c+v}{c-v}\\right)=L_2 \\frac{2 c}{c-v}=L \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}} \\frac{2 c}{c-v}$. Using the formula of image size given by the problem gives $d=\\frac{D f}{L^{\\prime}}=\\frac{D f}{L} \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}} \\frac{c-v}{2 c}$.  We're going to calculate the rate of change in the camera frame (since the video will show this). A very similar calculation as in part 1 . B. (b) gives $ \\dot{d}=D f \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}} \\frac{c-v}{2 c} \\frac{-\\dot{L}}{L^2}=\\frac{D f}{L^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}} \\frac{c-v}{2 c} \\frac{v \\mathrm{~d} t}{\\mathrm{~d} t \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\\frac{D f}{L^2} \\frac{v}{2 c} \\frac{c-v}{c+v} . $  This is the rate of change of the image width. (b) The difference between the reading of the clocks is the time required by the light to cover the distance to the mirror and back: $ A=\\frac{2 L_2}{c}=\\frac{2 L}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}} $ obviously the image of the clock shows an earlier time. Consequently, the reading $t^{\\prime}$ of the image and that $t$ of the clock is connected by $t=t^{\\prime}+\\frac{2 L}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$. Taking differentials: $\\mathrm{d} t=\\mathrm{d} t^{\\prime}+\\frac{2}{c} \\mathrm{~d} L \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}$. As the distance in the camera frame is given by $L_1=L \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$, its differential is $\\mathrm{d} L_1=\\mathrm{d} L \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$; on the other hand, this is $\\mathrm{d} L_1=-v \\mathrm{~d} t$ due to the definition of the velocity of the mirror in the camera frame: consequently, $\\mathrm{d} L=-\\frac{v \\mathrm{~d} t}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$. Substituting this into the previous equation: $   \\mathrm{d} t=\\mathrm{d} t^{\\prime}-2 v \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{(c-v)\\left(c^2-v^2\\right)}} \\mathrm{d} t=\\mathrm{d} t^{\\prime}-\\frac{2 v}{c-v} \\mathrm{~d} t \\\\  \\frac{\\mathrm{d} t^{\\prime}}{\\mathrm{d} t}=\\frac{c+v}{c-v}  $ thus during each tick of the clock one can observe $\\frac{c+v}{c-v}$ ticks of the image, that is, $ B=\\frac{c+v}{c-v} $  The task is to determine $L$ from $A$ and $B$ : it is easy to see that $L=\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{B}} \\frac{c}{2}$. This was to be found. (c) If the camera reaches the mirror, $L$ comes to be 0 , the difference between the readings will be $A=\\frac{2 L}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}}=0$, that is, both clocks will show the same time.

In order to do so, let's check a light ray that reaches the observer at an angle $\\alpha$ measured from the Earth-star central line. Let's assume it has travelled $\\tau$ from the star to the observer; consequently, it started from the surface of the star star $t-\\tau$ after the explosion; at this time, the radius of the star was $R_0+v(t-\\tau)$. We can use the law of cosines for the triangle formed by the observer, the centre of the star and the light source at the vertex of the observer: $ \\left(R_0+v(t-\\tau)\\right)^2=L^2+c^2 \\tau^2-2 L c \\tau \\cos \\alpha $ $ \\left(c^2-v^2\\right) \\tau^2+2\\left(v^2 t+R_0 v-L c \\cos \\alpha\\right) \\tau+\\left(L^2-\\left(R_0+v t\\right)^2\\right)=0 $  The number of real roots of this quadratic equation depends on the sign of its discriminant: if $D \\geq 0$ there is at least one solution for $\\tau$ (therefore, at the specific angle $\\alpha$ there will be light); however, if $D<0$, there will be no corresponding light source: at the boundary of the star, $D=0$ will hold: $   D=4\\left(v^2 t+R_0 v-L c \\cos \\theta\\right)^2-4\\left(c^2-v^2\\right)\\left(L^2-\\left(R_0+v t\\right)^2\\right)=0 \\\\  v\\left(R_0+v t\\right)-L c \\cos \\theta= \\pm \\sqrt{c^2-v^2} \\sqrt{L^2-\\left(R_0+v t\\right)^2} \\\\  \\cos \\theta=\\frac{v}{c} \\frac{R_0+v t}{L} \\pm \\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\left(R_0+v t\\right)^2}{L^2}}  $  Let $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such acute angles that $\\cos \\alpha=\\frac{v}{c}$ and $\\cos \\beta=\\frac{R_0+v t}{L}$. It is easy to see that $\\cos \\theta$ must be positive, therefore we retain the positive root: using the given substitution, it will be $\\cos (\\alpha-\\beta)$, thus $ \\theta=\\alpha-\\beta=\\arccos \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)-\\arccos \\left(\\frac{R_0+v t}{L}\\right) $  Now we take into account that the observer notes the phenomenon at $t_0=\\frac{L-R_0}{c}$ due to the speed of light; that is, it's more natural to measure time on a time scale $t^{\\prime}=t-t_0$ : using this substitution, we get $ \\theta=\\arccos \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)-\\arccos \\left(\\frac{R_0+v t^{\\prime}+\\frac{v}{c} L-\\frac{v}{c} R_0}{L}\\right)=\\arccos \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)-\\arccos \\left(\\frac{v}{c}+\\frac{\\frac{c-v}{c} R_0+v t^{\\prime}}{L}\\right) . $  This way depends the angular size of the star on time. Remark. If $t^{\\prime}$ is small, then $\\frac{\\frac{c-v}{c} R_0+v t^{\\prime}}{L}$ is small, too, so we can approximate the formula of $\\theta$ to the first order in it: $ \\theta=-\\frac{\\frac{c-v}{c} R_0+v t^{\\prime}}{L} \\cdot \\arccos ^{\\prime}\\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-v^2 / c^2}} \\frac{\\frac{c-v}{c} R_0+v t^{\\prime}}{L} . $  We should note, that at $t^{\\prime}=0$ this is definitely smaller than $\\arcsin \\left(\\frac{R_0}{L}\\right)$, the apparent radius of the star before the explosion: this problem is caused by that during calculations we haven't checked whether $t-\\tau>0$, in other words, whether the star has exploded already. At small values of $t^{\\prime}$ it's possible that we took into account such extrapolated states of the star in which its radius is smaller than $R_0$ that doesn't happen actually. This problem can be fixed the most easily this way: the radius of the star is $ \\theta=\\max \\left[\\arcsin \\left(\\frac{R_0}{L}\\right) ; \\arccos \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)-\\arccos \\left(\\frac{v}{c}+\\frac{\\frac{c-v}{c} R_0+v t^{\\prime}}{L}\\right)\\right]: $ this formula discards effects of extrapolation explicitly.",

Consider a flow of the viscous fluid through a tube with length $L_0$ and radius $r_0$ (Figure 4). Fluid molecules moves along free paths and collide with each other.

Close to the solid boundary molecules are stuck, while in other regions velocity varies, with a profile similar to the sketch shown in Figure 4, where $y$ is measured from the axis of the tube. The reason for this effect is the internal friction of the fluid, or viscosity. If two adjacent layers of fluid flow with slightly different speeds, the random sidewise intrusion of some faster molecules into the slower stream will tend to speed up the slower stream, whereas intrusion of slower molecules into the faster stream will tend to slow down the faster stream. This effect could be quantified with following well-known equation: $ F_{f r}=-\\mu A_{f r} \\frac{d v}{d y} $ where $F_{f r}$ is a friction force which occurs between two thin layers of the fluid separated by a small distance $d y$, which have differences in velocities $d v ; A_{f r}$ is a contact area on which applied the internal friction force; $\\mu$ is the fluid property called coefficient of viscosity.

In the model supposed that the production from fractured reservoir goes from the matrix to the fracture and therefrom to the well. Thus, matrix does not produce directly into the well.

They are powered by alternating current, and they do not contain commutators, slip rings or brushes. They consist of a stator and a rotor (see fig. 1). The stator is a fixed set of coils, which produces a rotating magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the motor. The rotor is just a cage, i.e., a set of closed metallic loops attached to the axis of the motor. The rotating magnetic field produced by the stator induces electric current in the loops of the cage, which behave as magnetic dipoles, and interact with the external field of the stator. As a result, a torque is exerted on the rotor, and it starts rotating. In a simplified model (see fig. 2) we assume that the magnetic induction vector $\\mathbf{B}$ produced by the stator is rotating in the $x-y$ plane at a constant angular velocity $\\Omega$, and it has a constant magnitude $\\mathbf{B}$. The axis of the rotor is in the $z$ direction. The rotor is assumed to be a flat coil of area $A$, winding number $N$, Ohmic resistance $R$ and self inductance $L$. The vector $\\mathbf{n}$ perpendicular to this coil is rotating also in the $x-y$ plane. First we study the stationary operation of the motor, when its angular velocity $\\omega$ and torque $T$ are constant. As we shall see, when the motor is loaded, its angular velocity $\\omega$ gets smaller than $\\Omega$. It is convenient to characterize this shift by the slip $ s=\\frac{\\Omega-\\omega}{\\Omega}, $ which is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 .

        "solution": "As there is no friction in the system, there is no horizontal force at all, therefore the horizontal component of the system's momentum is conserved and since it was 0 initially, it will be 0 in the final setup as well. Consequently, the horizontal component of the CM's velocity is 0 , thus it will move vertically. The center of the lower ball must have a purely horizontal velocity, as the contact point with the ground can only move so and its relative velocity to the mentioned center is horizontal too (it is a peripheral speed related to a vertical position vector).  The vector from the CM to the center of the lower ball in the final state (Figure 2) is $\\mathbf{r}_1=$ $x_0(-\\sin \\alpha, \\cos \\alpha)$, thus the vector of the relative velocity is $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text {rel, } 1}=\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{r}_1=x_0 \\omega(\\cos \\alpha, \\sin \\alpha)$.

        "solution": "Both contact points with the ground will move without slipping. Consequently, if the body rotates about its symmetry axis by some angle, these points will move by distances the ratio of which is $R_2 / R_1$ : this means that the orbits of these points are two concentrical circles with radii of this ratio. The common center of these circles will be a permanent center of the rotation, therefore we will calculate with respect to axes passing through this point. Now we determine the distance $D$ of this center to the CM. As the center $O$ must be the intersection point of the symmetry axis $O_1 O_2$ and the plane the body is placed on, we can write down the following equation due to the similar right triangles $O O_1 T_1$ and $O O_2 T_2$ : $ \\frac{D+x_0^{\\prime}}{R_2}=\\frac{D-x_0}{R_1} \\rightarrow D=\\frac{R_1^4+R_2^4}{\\left(R_1^2-R_1 R_2+R_2^2\\right)\\left(R_2-R_1\\right)} . $  However, the line joining the touching points of the body and the plane is the momentary rotational axis of the body due to the slipless motion. Therefore, the angular velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ must be in this line. The angle $\\gamma$ in the figure can simply be expressed by $\\sin \\gamma=\\frac{R_2-R_1}{R_2+R_1} \\rightarrow \\cos \\gamma=\\frac{2 \\sqrt{R_1 R_2}}{R_1+R_2}$, so the components of this vector in the principal coordinate system are $\\omega_1=\\omega \\sin \\gamma$ and $\\omega_2=\\omega \\cos \\gamma$. The moments of inertia with respect to axes passing through this point are $I_{\\perp}+\\left(m_1+m_2\\right) D^2$ and $I_{\\|}$, respectively.  Now we're going to write down the total energy of the system. The kinetic energy can be written solely as rotational energy with respect to point $O$ : using the above expressions of the moments of inertia and angular velocities we find $ K=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(I_{\\perp}+\\left(m_1+m_2\\right) D^2\\right) \\omega^2 \\sin ^2 \\gamma+\\frac{1}{2} I_{\\|} \\omega^2 \\cos ^2 \\gamma=\\frac{14 \\pi}{15} \\rho \\omega^2\\left(R_1^5+R_2^5\\right) . $  The CM of the system is moving on a circle in a plane somewhat above the inclined plane and parallel to it. The radius of this circle is $R=D \\cos \\gamma=\\frac{2\\left(R_1^4+R_2^4\\right) \\sqrt{R_1 R_2}}{\\left(R_1^2-R_1 R_2+R_2^2\\right)\\left(R_2^2-R_1^2\\right)}$. Let $\\theta$ be the angle between the line joining the touching points and the horizontal edge of the plane. If we choose the zero level of the gravitational potential energy at the state $\\theta=\\pi / 2$, we can simply express the potential energy as $ V=\\left(m_1+m_2\\right) g \\Delta h=-\\left(m_1+m_2\\right) g R \\cos \\theta \\sin \\alpha=\\frac{8 \\pi}{3} \\rho g \\frac{R_1^4+R_2^4}{R_1-R_2} \\sqrt{R_1 R_2} \\cos \\theta \\sin \\alpha . $  As there is no energy loss due to friction, the total energy $K+V$ is constant. The energy initially is 0 as $\\omega=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi / 2$ : due to the conservation of energy, this will hold all along the motion. Therefore, the less is the potential energy, the more is the kinetic energy and so the velocities. From the expression of $V$ we can see that the minimal potential energy at $\\theta=0$ is $\\frac{8 \\pi}{3} \\rho g \\frac{R_1^4+R_2^4}{R_1-R_2} \\sqrt{R_1 R_2} \\sin \\alpha$, the opposite of which is the maximal kinetic energy: $ \\frac{8 \\pi}{3} \\rho g \\frac{R_1^4+R_2^4}{R_2-R_1} \\sqrt{R_1 R_2} \\sin \\alpha=\\frac{14 \\pi}{15} \\rho \\omega_{\\max }^2\\left(R_1^5+R_2^5\\right) $ $ \\omega_{\\max }=\\sqrt{\\frac{20}{7} g \\frac{\\left(R_1^4+R_2^4\\right) \\sqrt{R_1 R_2}}{\\left(R_2-R_1\\right)\\left(R_1^5+R_2^5\\right)} \\sin \\alpha} $ as the distances of the centers of the balls to the rotational axis are $R_1$ and $R_2$, the maximal velocities of these centers are $   v_{1, \\max }=R_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{7} g \\frac{\\left(R_1^4+R_2^4\\right) \\sqrt{R_1 R_2}}{\\left(R_2-R_1\\right)\\left(R_1^5+R_2^5\\right)} \\sin \\alpha}=0.4517 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} ; \\\\  v_{2, \\max }=R_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{7} g \\frac{\\left(R_1^4+R_2^4\\right) \\sqrt{R_1 R_2}}{\\left(R_2-R_1\\right)\\left(R_1^5+R_2^5\\right)} \\sin \\alpha}=0.9033 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} .  $",

        "problem": "Thermal atmospheric escape is a process in which small gas molecules reach speeds high enough to escape the gravitational field of the Earth and reach outer space. Particles in a gas collide with each other due to their thermal energy. These collisions constantly accelerate and decelerate particles, varying their speed continuously. Paticles might be accelerated until they reach the socalled escape velocity and leave the atmosphere. This process, known as Jeans escape, is critical for the formation and maintenance or the evaporation of the atmosphere of a planet. It is believed that it played an important role in the loss of water from Venus and Mars atmospheres, due to their lower escape velocity.  In this problem we will quantify the scattering (collisions between gas particles) and rate of loss of hydrogen in Earths atmosphere. The modulus and direction velocity distribution of the molecules of a gas of mass $m$ and at a temperature $T$ is given by the Maxwellian distribution: $ f(v) d^3 v=\\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi k T}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{m v^2}{2 k T}\\right) v^2 \\sin (\\theta) d v d \\theta d \\varphi $ where $d^3 v$ is the velocity differential. In spherical coordinates it is expressed as $d^3 v=v^2 \\sin (\\theta) d v d \\theta d \\varphi$. Thus at any temperature there can always be some molecules whose velocity is greater than the escape velocity. A molecule located in the lower part of the atmosphere would not, in general, be able to escape to outer space even though its velocity is greater than the limit velocity because it would soon collide with other molecules, losing a big part of its energy. In order to escape, these molecules need to be at a certain height such that density is so low that their probability of colliding is negligible. The region in the atmosphere where this condition is satisfied is called exosphere and its lower boundary, which separates the dense zone from the exosphere, is called exobase. The temperature at the exobase is roughly $1000 \\mathrm{~K}$. Exobase is defined as the height above which a radially outward moving particle will suffer less than one backscattering collision on average. This means that the mean free path has to be equal to the scale height, which is defined as the height where the atmospheres density is $\\frac{1}{e}$ lower than on Earths surface $\\left(R_E=6.37 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$. The mean free path $\\lambda$ is the average distance covered by a moving particle in a gas (that we consider to be ideal) between two consecutive collisions and this can be expressed by the following equality: $ \\lambda(h)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma n_V(h)}, $ where $\\sigma$ is the effective cross sectional area for the collision hydrogen atom-atmosphere $\\sigma=2 \\times$ $10^{-19} m^2$ and $n_V$ is the number of molecules per unit volume. Atmospheres density decreases with exponentially from altitude $250 \\mathrm{~km}$ : $ P(h)=P_{R e f} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{\\left(h-h_{R e f}\\right)}{H}\\right), $ where we know that at an altitude of $250 \\mathrm{~km}$, the pressure is $21 \\mu \\mathrm{Pa} .

Assume that the relativistic and the electromagnetic radiation effects can be neglected, unless otherwise stated. Start with a case, where a point small charged object with a charge $+Q$ is fastened to the table. The center of the dipole is fixed at the distance $L$ from the charged object (see Figure 1). The dipole consists of two identical small balls fastened to the tiny, rigid rod with a length $d, d \\ll L$, so that the moment of inertia can be ignored. Each of the balls has a mass $m$ and have charge $+q$ and $-q$. The dipole can rotate around its center in a plane parallel to the surface of the smooth table. Calculate the period of the small oscillations $T$ of the dipole around its stable equilibrium axis in the electrostatic field of the charged object.  Now, the dipole freely moves around the charged object, which is still fastened to the table. The dipole is launched with an initial velocity $\\mathbf{u}$, as shown in Figure 2. The parameters of the system are chosen in such a way that the period of oscillation of the dipole in the electrostatic field of the fixed object is large enough to assume that the dipole is always oriented along the line between the dipole and the charged object.",

        "solution": "For this problem to solve, we first imagine the dodecahedron without a removed wire segment. Now let enter a charge $Q_{\\text {enter }}$ at the vertex $E$ and a charge of $Q_{\\text {exit }}=$ $-\\frac{Q_{e n t e r}}{19}$ at every other vertex of the polyhedron. This is of course a symmetrically situation, so we conclude that the capacity of the wire segment $E A$ contains a charge of $\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{3}$ and the capacity of the wire segment $A B$ contains a charge of $\\frac{\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}+Q_{\\text {exit }}}{3}}{2}$. According to the Helmholtz principle (principle of superposition) we can now also take a look at the same situation and with an entering charge of $Q_{\\text {enter }}^{\\prime}=-Q_{\\text {enter }}$ at $B$ and an exiting charge $Q_{\\text {exit }}^{\\prime}=-\\frac{Q_{e n t e r}^{\\prime}}{19}$ at every vertex and add those charge distributions to the ones of the first case. In total there is at $E$ an entering charge of $Q_{\\text {total }}=Q_{\\text {enter }}+Q_{\\text {exit }}^{\\prime}=Q_{\\text {enter }}-\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}^{\\prime}}{19}=Q_{\\text {enter }}+\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{19}=\\frac{20}{19} Q_{\\text {enter }}$ and in $B$ there is charge of $-\\frac{20}{19} Q_{\\text {enter }}$ entering or in other terms a charge of $\\frac{20}{19} Q_{\\text {enter }}$ leaving. At every other vertex there is a total of $Q_{\\text {exit }}+Q_{\\text {exit }}^{\\prime}=Q_{\\text {exit }}-Q_{\\text {exit }}=0$, so there is no charge exiting or entering. And the capacities at the wire segments $E A$ and $A B$ both contain a charge of $\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{3}+\\frac{\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{3}+Q_{\\text {exit }}}{2}=\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{3}+\\frac{\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{3}-\\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{10}}{2}=$ $Q_{\\text {enter }} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{19}}{2}\\right)=Q_{\\text {enter }} \\cdot \\frac{2+1-\\frac{3}{19}}{6}=Q_{\\text {enter }} \\cdot \\frac{9}{19}$. That is why there has to be a voltage drop of $U=\\frac{Q}{C}=\\frac{9}{19} \\cdot \\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{C}$ over each capacity so between the vertices $E$ and $B$ there is a potential drop of $U_{\\text {total }}=\\frac{18}{19} \\frac{Q_{\\text {enter }}}{C}$. So we can determine the capacity of the whole dodecahedron between the vertices $E$ and $B$ to $C_{\\text {dodecahedron }}=\\frac{Q_{\\text {total }}}{U_{\\text {total }}}=$ $\\frac{\\frac{20}{19} Q_{\\text {enter }}}{\\frac{18}{19} \\frac{Q_{\\text {entex }}}{C}}=\\frac{20}{18} C$. Now, this whole capacity can be calculated from the equivalent capacity over the wire segments $E A$ and $A B$, which is $\\frac{1}{C_{\\text {equiv }}}=\\frac{1}{C}+\\frac{1}{C} \\Leftrightarrow C_{\\text {equiv }}=\\frac{C}{2}$, and the capacity $C_{\\text {solution }}$ which we are looking for. Because these two capacities are parallel (and because of symmetry there is no drop of voltage over the wire segment $A D)$ they have to fulfill the equation $C_{\\text {equiv }}+C_{\\text {solution }}=C_{\\text {dodecohedron }} \\Leftrightarrow C_{\\text {solution }}=$ $C_{\\text {dodecahedron }}-C_{\\text {equiv }}=\\left(\\frac{20}{18}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) C=\\frac{11}{18} C$.

The reason is that depressurizing and warming of the water causes the initially dissolved gas to come out of the solution and form tiny bubbles. In this problem you are going to calculate the size of such gas bubble in water.  A photographer prepared a setup consisting of a rectangular water tank with glass walls, a laser beam entering the water tank perpendicularly to one of its faces, and a camera looking directly towards a neighbouring face of the water tank. A gas bubbled entered the laser beam and the photographer managed to take five photos of the bubble while continuously defocusing the camera. The lens had \"internal focusing\" design, so that defocusing meant changing the focal length while keeping the position of the lens intact, see figure. The line of sight from the camera to the bubble was perpendicular to the laser beam, and the bubble was entirely inside the beam. In the figure below, the taken photos are placed side by side and indicated by numbers $1-5$. Task: calculate the diameter of the gas bubble. Parameters: index of refraction of water with respect to gas: $n=1.3$; wavelength of the laser: $\\lambda=488 \\mathrm{~nm}$; the lens of the camera can be considered as a single convex lens with focal length $f=10 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and diameter $D=3.6 \\mathrm{~cm}$ (the change of the focal length due to defocusing was less than $10 \\%$ ); the distance from the bubble to the lens: $L=30 \\mathrm{~cm}$ (more precisely, this is the distance from the lens to the image of the bubble as seen from the centre of the lens, see figure above).",

        "solution": "We want to identify each ray by its number of interactions I with the gas bubble. Therefore a number of interactions I means 2 transmissions/refractions and I-2 reflections. In order to minimize loss of intensity we have to investigate rays with minimal number of interactions. We are looking for 2 rays, that can interfere with each other. Therefore one ray has to be the directly reflected with incident angle of $45^{\\circ}$. Let $\\alpha$ be incident angle and $\\beta$ be refraction angle. Each incident angle inside is $\\beta$. That can be concluded by simple geometric analysis. By each reflection the ray rotates about $2 \\beta-\\pi$, by each refraction/transmission the ray rotates about $\\beta-\\alpha$. Let the aperture be at an angle $\\pi / 2$ from line bubble-laser.  We have to minimize $\\mathrm{I}$, therefore we begin with $\\mathrm{I}=2$ ( $\\mathrm{I}=1$ would mean one reflection): $\\boldsymbol{I}=\\mathbf{2}$ Transmitted ray rotates about $2(\\beta-\\alpha)$ and that has to be $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (1) $\\beta=\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ $   n \\sin \\alpha=\\sin \\beta \\\\  n \\sin \\alpha=\\sin \\left(\\alpha+\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\sin \\alpha \\cdot \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\sin \\alpha+\\cos \\alpha) \\\\  \\Rightarrow \\tan \\alpha=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot n-1}=1.193 \\Rightarrow \\alpha=\\arctan 1.193 \\approx 50^{\\circ} \\Rightarrow \\beta=95^{\\circ}  $  But this is impossible, because $\\quad \\beta>90^{\\circ}$ means the ray would be total reflected. Therefore $\\mathrm{I}=2$ is not of interest. $\\boldsymbol{I}=3$ (1) $4 \\beta-2 \\alpha=\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\Rightarrow \\alpha=2 \\beta-\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ from simple geometric consideration (2) $n \\cdot \\sin \\left(2 \\beta-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=\\sin \\beta \\Rightarrow f(\\beta)=n \\cdot \\sin \\left(2 \\beta-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)-\\sin \\beta$  We solve this equation by using Newton's method: $ \\begin{gathered} \\beta_{n+1}=\\beta_n-\\frac{f\\left(\\beta_n\\right)}{f^{\\prime}\\left(\\beta_n\\right)} \\\\ \\beta_{n+1}=\\beta_n-\\frac{n \\sin \\left(2 \\beta_n-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)-\\sin \\beta_n}{2 n \\cos \\left(2 \\beta_n-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)-\\cos \\left(\\beta_n\\right)}, \\beta_0=40^{\\circ} \\end{gathered} $  We get the approximated angle $\\beta=35.9^{\\circ}$. It follows from this: $\\alpha=26.8^{\\circ}$. These angles seem to be the right ones because they satisfy the conditions stated above.We need the distance of the first and the second ray.

The interference pattern is very similar to the one produced by a lattice with lattice parameter $d_r$. $ \\Delta s=m \\cdot \\lambda=d_r \\cdot \\sin \\gamma, $ where $\\gamma$ is the angle under which a maximum is seen. Let $\\delta$ be the aperture angle, under which light can be travel trough the lense. Obviously it is: $ \\tan \\delta \\approx \\delta=\\frac{D}{L} ; \\quad \\delta \\ll 1 \\text { because of } L \\gg D $  If $\\mathrm{N}$ is the total number of interference bands we can say, that unter the angle $\\frac{\\delta}{2}$ we can see the $\\frac{N}{2}$-th maximum. Therefore $ \\begin{gathered} \\frac{N}{2} \\cdot \\lambda=d_r \\sin \\frac{\\delta}{2} \\approx d_r \\cdot \\frac{\\delta}{2} \\Rightarrow N \\lambda=d_r \\delta=\\frac{d_r \\cdot D}{L} \\\\ d_r=\\frac{L \\cdot N \\lambda}{D} \\end{gathered} $  Setting (4) into (3) we get: $ d=\\frac{2 \\cdot L \\cdot N \\cdot \\lambda}{D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4}+\\sin \\alpha} $  Now we want to set in the numerical values: $N=9, \\alpha=26.8^{\\circ}$ and the given information from the text.

        "solution": "Since both the support and the plate is superconducting, magnetic field lines cannot go through them, otherwise voltage would be induced in them: for the same reason, the flux in the holes is constant. Therefore, the field lines that get under the plate at the holes will go under it to the edges: this distance is much larger than the vertical room in which the field lines can exist, thus the lines under the plate will be essentially horizontal. It follows as well that the shape of the field lines above the plate will not vary as $d$ varies, thus the magnetic energy in this region is constant.  Now we're going to calculate, how the magnetic energy stored between the plate and the support depends on $d$. We should consider that this field is almost entirely horizontal and that the same flux should be distributed in the varying room: these together yield that at a specified point, $B \\sim 1 / d$. Therefore, at all points the magnetic energy density is proportional to $B^2 \\sim 1 / d^2$, thus the average magnetic energy density is proportional to $1 / d^2$ as well. As the volume of the space of interest is proportional to $d$, the magnetic energy stored under the plate is proportional to $1 / d$.  The magnetic energy (omitting the constant part that is stored above the plate) is thus $W=K / d$ where $K$ is constant. The repulsive force is then $F=-\\mathrm{d} W / \\mathrm{d} d=K / d^2$. When in the first case the system is balanced, $F=m g$, from this, $d=\\sqrt{K / m g}$. The net force in the small oscillation approximation is $F(d+\\mathrm{d} d)-m g=K\\left(1 /(d+\\mathrm{d} d)^2-1 / d^2\\right)=-2 K / d^3 \\cdot \\mathrm{d} d$ : using this, the frequency of the oscillations is $ \\nu_0=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 K / d^3}{m}}}{2 \\pi}=\\frac{g^{3 / 4} m^{1 / 4}}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi K^{1 / 4}} . $  Consequently, the frequency is proportional to $m^{1 / 4}$ where $m$ is the mass of the load.

        "solution": "The liquid boils when the pressure of its saturated vapor is equal to the external pressure. Thus, in order to find the boiling temperature of the liquid $i(i-\\mathrm{A}$ or $\\mathrm{B})$, one should determine such a temperature $T_{b i}$ (or $t_{b i}$ ) for which $p_i / p_0=1$.

        "solution": "As the liquids are in thermal contact with each other, their temperatures increase in time in the same way.  At the beginning of the heating, what corresponds to the left sloped part of the diagram, no evaporation can occur. The free evaporation from the upper surface of the liquid B cannot occur - it is impossible due to the layer of the non-volatile liquid $\\mathrm{C}$. The evaporation from the inside of the system is considered below.  Let us consider a bubble formed in the liquid A or in the liquid B or on the surface that separates these liquids. Such a bubble can be formed due to fluctuations or for many other reasons, which will not be analyzed here.  The bubble can get out of the system only when the pressure inside it equals to the external pressure $p_0$ (or when it is a little bit higher than $p_0$ ). Otherwise, the bubble will collapse.  The pressure inside the bubble formed in the volume of the liquid $\\mathrm{A}$ or in the volume of the liquid B equals to the pressure of the saturated vapor of the liquid A or B, respectively. However, the pressure inside the bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids A and B is equal to the sum of the pressures of the saturated vapors of both these liquids, as then the bubble is in a contact with the liquids A and B at the same time. In the case considered the pressure inside the bubble is greater than the pressures of the saturated vapors of each of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ (at the same temperature).  Therefore, when the system is heated, the pressure $p_0$ is reached first in the bubbles that were formed on the surface separating the liquids. Thus, the temperature $t_1$ corresponds to a kind of common boiling of both liquids that occurs in the region of their direct contact. The temperature $t_1$ is for sure lower than the boiling temperatures of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ as then the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are less then $p_0$ (their sum equals to $p_0$ and each of them is greater than zero). In order to determine the value of $t_1$ with required accuracy, we can calculate the values of the sum of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B for several values of the temperature $t$ and look when one gets the value $p_0$. From the formula given in the text of the problem, we have: $   \\frac{p_A}{p_0}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_A}{T}+\\beta_A}, \\\\  \\frac{p_B}{p_0}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_B}{T}+\\beta_B} .  $ $p_A+p_B$ equals to $p_0$ if $ \\frac{p_A}{p_0}+\\frac{p_B}{p_0}=1 $  Thus, we have to calculate the values of the following function: $ y(x)=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_A}{t+t_0}+\\beta_A}+e^{\\frac{\\alpha_B}{t+t_0}+\\beta_B}, $ (where $t_0=273.15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and to determine the temperature $t=t_1$, at which $y(t)$ equals to 1 . When calculating the values of the function $y(t)$ we can divide the intervals of the temperatures $t$ by 2 (approximately) and look whether the results are greater or less than 1 . We have: Table 1.2 \\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \\hline$t$  $y(t)$ \\\\ \\hline $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$  $<1($ see Tab. 1.1$)$ \\\\ \\hline $77^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$  $>1\\left(\\right.$ as $t_1$ is less than $\\left.t_{b A}\\right)$ \\\\ \\hline $59^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$  $0.749<1$ \\\\ \\hline $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$  $1.113>1$ \\\\ \\hline $66^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$  $0.966<1$ \\\\ \\hline $67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$  $1.001>1$ \\\\ \\hline $66.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$  $0.983<1$ \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}  Therefore, $t_1 \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (with required accuracy). Now we calculate the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B at the temperature $t_1 \\approx 67^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, i.e. the pressures of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B in each bubble formed on the surface separating the liquids. From the equations $  \\frac{p_A}{p_0}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_A}{T}+\\beta_A} \\\\  \\frac{p_B}{p_0}=e^{\\frac{\\alpha_B}{T}+\\beta_B}$, we get: $   p_A \\approx 0.734 p_0, \\\\  p_B \\approx 0.267 p_0, \\\\  \\left(p_A+p_B=1.001 p_0 \\approx p_0\\right) .  $  These pressures depend only on the temperature and, therefore, they remain constant during the motion of the bubbles through the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$. The volume of the bubbles during this motion also cannot be changed without violation of the relation $p_A+p_B=p_0$. It follows from the above remarks that the mass ratio of the saturated vapors of the liquids A and B in each bubble is the same. This conclusion remains valid as long as both liquids are in the system. After total evaporation of one of the liquids the temperature of the system will increase again (second sloped part of the diagram). Then, however, the mass of the system remains constant until the temperature reaches the value $t_2$ at which the boiling of the liquid (remained in the vessel) starts. Therefore, the temperature $t_2$ (the higher horizontal part of the diagram) corresponds to the boiling of the liquid remained in the vessel.  The mass ratio $m_A / m_B$ of the saturated vapors of the liquids $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ in each bubble leaving the system at the temperature $t_1$ is equal to the ratio of the densities of these vapors $\\rho_A / \\rho_B$. According to the assumption 2, stating that the vapors can be treated as ideal gases, the last ratio equals to the ratio of the products of the pressures of the saturated vapors by the molecular masses: $ \\frac{m_A}{m_B}=\\frac{\\rho_A}{\\rho_B}=\\frac{p_A \\mu_A}{p_B \\mu_B}=\\frac{p_A}{p_B} \\mu . $  Thus, $ \\frac{m_A}{m_B} \\approx 22.0 . $  We see that the liquid A evaporates 22 times faster than the liquid B. The evaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid A during the \"surface boiling\" at the temperature $t_1$ is associated with the evaporation of $100 \\mathrm{~g} / 22 \\approx 4.5 \\mathrm{~g}$ of the liquid B. Thus, at the time $\\tau_1$ the vessel contains 95.5 $\\mathrm{g}$ of the liquid $\\mathrm{B}$ (and no liquid A). The temperature $t_2$ is equal to the boiling temperature of the liquid B: $t_2=100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.",

        "solution": "As the system is isolated, its total energy, i.e. the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, is conserved. The total potential energy of the points $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2$ and $\\mathrm{P}_3$ with the masses $m_1, m_2$ and $m_3$ in the inertial system (i.e. when there are no inertial forces) is equal to the sum of the gravitational potential energies of all the pairs of points $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2\\right),\\left(\\mathrm{P}_2, \\mathrm{P}_3\\right)$ and $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_3\\right)$. It depends only on the distances $a_{12}, a_{23}$ and $a_{23}$ which are constant in time. Thus, the total potential energy of the system is constant. As a consequence the kinetic energy of the system is constant too. The moment of inertia of the system with respect to the axis $\\sigma$ depends only on the distances from the points $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2$ and $\\mathrm{P}_3$ to the axis $\\sigma$ which, for fixed $a_{12}, a_{23}$ and $a_{23}$ do not depend on time. This means that the moment of inertia $I$ is constant. Therefore, the angular velocity of the system must also be constant: $ \\omega=\\text { const. } $  This is the first condition we had to find. The other conditions will be determined by using three methods described below. However, prior to performing calculations, it is desirable to specify a convenient coordinates system in which the calculations are expected to be simple.  Let the positions of the points $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2$ and $\\mathrm{P}_3$ with the masses $m_1, m_2$ and $m_3$ be given by the vectors $\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2$ and $\\mathbf{r}_3$. For simplicity we assume that the origin of the coordinate system is localized at the center of mass of the points $\\mathrm{P}_1, \\mathrm{P}_2$ and $\\mathrm{P}_3$ with the masses $m_1, m_2$ and $m_3$ and that all the vectors $\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2$ and $\\mathbf{r}_3$ are in the same coordinate plane, e.g. in the plane $(x, y)$. Then the axis $\\sigma$ is the axis $z$. In this coordinate system, according to the definition of the center of mass, we have: $ m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1+m_2 \\mathbf{r}_2+m_3 \\mathbf{r}_2=0 $  Now we will find the second condition by using several methods. Consider the point $\\mathrm{P}_1$ with the mass $m_1$. The points $\\mathrm{P}_2$ and $\\mathrm{P}_3$ act on it with the forces: $   \\mathbf{F}_{21}=G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{a_{12}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right), \\\\  \\mathbf{F}_{31}=G \\frac{m_1 m_3}{a_{13}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_3-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right) .  $ where $G$ denotes the gravitational constant. In the inertial frame the sum of these forces is the centripetal force $ \\mathbf{F}_{r 1}=-m_1 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{r}_1, $ which causes the movement of the point $\\mathrm{P}_1$ along a circle with the angular velocity $\\omega$. (The moment of this force with respect to the axis $\\sigma$ is equal to zero.) Thus, we have: $ \\mathbf{F}_{21}+\\mathbf{F}_{31}=\\mathbf{F}_{r 1} . $  In the non-inertial frame, rotating around the axis $\\sigma$ with the angular velocity $\\omega$, the sum of the forces $   \\mathbf{F}_{21}=G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{a_{12}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right), \\\\  \\mathbf{F}_{31}=G \\frac{m_1 m_3}{a_{13}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_3-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right) .  $ and the centrifugal force $ \\mathbf{F}_{r 1}^{\\prime}=m_1 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{r}_1 $ should be equal to zero: $ \\mathbf{F}_{21}+\\mathbf{F}_{31}+\\mathbf{F}_{r 1}^{\\prime}=0 . $ (The moment of this sum with respect to any axis equals to zero.) The conditions $\\mathbf{F}_{21}+\\mathbf{F}_{31}=\\mathbf{F}_{r 1}$ and $\\mathbf{F}_{21}+\\mathbf{F}_{31}+\\mathbf{F}_{r 1}^{\\prime}=0$ are equivalent. They give the same vector equality: $   G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{a_{12}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+G \\frac{m_1 m_3}{a_{13}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_3-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+m_1 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{r}_1=0, \\\\  G \\frac{m_1}{a_{12}^3} m_2 \\mathbf{r}_2+G \\frac{m_1}{a_{13}^3} m_3 \\mathbf{r}_3+m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1\\left(\\omega^2-\\frac{G m_2}{a_{12}^3}-\\frac{G m_3}{a_{13}^3}\\right)=0  $  From the formula $m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1+m_2 \\mathbf{r}_2+m_3 \\mathbf{r}_2=0$, we get: $ m_2 \\mathbf{r}_2=-m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1-m_3 \\mathbf{r}_3 $  Using this relation, we write the formula $G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{a_{12}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+G \\frac{m_1 m_3}{a_{13}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_3-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+m_1 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{r}_1=0$ in the following form: $ G \\frac{m_1}{a_{12}^3}\\left(-m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1-m_3 \\mathbf{r}_3\\right)+G \\frac{m_1}{a_{13}^3} m_3 \\mathbf{r}_3+m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1\\left(\\omega^2-\\frac{G m_2}{a_{12}^3}-\\frac{G m_3}{a_{13}^3}\\right)=0, $ i.e. $ \\mathbf{r}_1 m_1\\left(\\omega^2-\\frac{G m_2}{a_{12}^3}-\\frac{G m_3}{a_{13}^3}-\\frac{G m_1}{a_{12}^3}\\right)+\\mathbf{r}_3\\left(\\frac{1}{a_{13}^3}-\\frac{1}{a_{12}^3}\\right) G m_1 m_3=0 . $  The vectors $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_3$ are non-collinear. Therefore, the coefficients in the last formula must be equal to zero: $ \\left(\\frac{1}{a_{13}^3}-\\frac{1}{a_{12}^3}\\right) G m_1 m_3=0 $ $ m_1\\left(\\omega^2-\\frac{G m_2}{a_{12}^3}-\\frac{G m_3}{a_{13}^3}-\\frac{G m_1}{a_{12}^3}\\right)=0 . $  The first equality leads to: $ \\frac{1}{a_{13}^3}=\\frac{1}{a_{12}^3} $ and hence, $ a_{13}=a_{12} . $  Let $a_{13}=a_{12}=a$. Then the second equality gives: $ \\omega^2 a^3=G M $ where $ M=m_1+m_2+m_3 $ denotes the total mass of the system. In the same way, for the points $\\mathrm{P}_2$ and $\\mathrm{P}_3$, one gets the relations: a) the point $P_2$ : $ a_{23}=a_{12} ; \\quad \\omega^2 a^3=G M $ b) the point $\\mathrm{P}_3$ : $ a_{13}=a_{23} ; \\quad \\omega^2 a^3=G M $  Summarizing, the system can rotate as a rigid body if all the distances between the masses are equal: $ a_{12}=a_{23}=a_{13}=a, $ the angular velocity $\\omega$ is constant and the relation $\\omega^2 a^3=G M$ holds.",
        "solution_2": "At the beginning we find the moment of inertia $I$ of the system with respect to the axis $\\sigma$.

In the non-inertial frame, rotating around the axis $\\sigma$ with the angular velocity $\\omega$, the total potential energy $V_{\\text {tot }}$ is the sum of the gravitational potential energies $ V_{i j}=-G \\frac{m_i m_j}{a_{i j}} ; \\quad i, j=1,2,3 ; i<j $ of all the masses and the potential energies $ V_i=-\\frac{1}{2} \\omega^2 m_i r_i^2 ; \\quad i=1,2,3 $ of the masses $m_i(i=1,2,3)$ in the field of the centrifugal force: $   V_{t o t}=G \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{m_i m_j}{a_{i j}}-\\frac{1}{2} \\omega^2 \\sum_{i=1}^3 m_i r_i^2=G \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{m_i m_j}{a_{i j}}-\\frac{1}{2} \\omega^2 I=G \\sum_{i<j} \\frac{m_i m_j}{a_{i j}}-\\frac{1}{2} \\omega^2 \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i<j} m_i m_j a_{i j}^2= \\\\  =-\\sum_{i<j} m_i m_j\\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{2 M} a_{i j}^2+\\frac{G}{a_{i j}}\\right)  $ i.e. $ V_{t o t}=-\\sum_{i<j} m_i m_j\\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{2 M} a_{i j}^2+\\frac{G}{a_{i j}}\\right) . $  A mechanical system is in equilibrium if its total potential energy has an extremum. In our case the total potential energy $V_{\\text {tot }}$ is a sum of three terms. Each of them is proportional to: $ f(a)=\\frac{\\omega^2}{2 M} a^2+\\frac{G}{a} . $  The extrema of this function can be found by taking its derivative with respect to $a$ and requiring this derivative to be zero.

(In addition, the values of $a$ and $\\omega$ should obey the relation written above.) It is easy to show that it is a maximum. Thus, the quantity $V_{t o t}$ has a maximum at $a_{i j}=a$.  This means that our three masses can remain in fixed distances only if these distances are equal to each other: $ a_{12}=a_{23}=a_{13}=a $ and if the relation $ \\omega^2 a^3=G M, $ where $M$ the total mass of the system, holds.

Therefore $ \\mathbf{r}_3 \\times \\mathbf{r}_1 \\neq 0 $ and $ \\frac{1}{a_{13}^3}-\\frac{1}{a_{12}^3}=0 $ hence, $ a_{12}=a_{13} . $  Similarly, one gets: $ a_{12}=a_{23}(=a) . $  We have re-derived the condition $a_{12}=a_{23}=a_{13}=a$. Taking into account that all the distances $a_{i j}$ have the same value $a$, from the equation $G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{a_{12}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+G \\frac{m_1 m_3}{a_{13}^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_3-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+m_1 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{r}_1=0$ concerning the point $\\mathrm{P}_1$, using the relation $m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1+m_2 \\mathbf{r}_2+m_3 \\mathbf{r}_2=0$ we obtain: $ \\begin{gathered} G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{a^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_2-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+G \\frac{m_1 m_3}{a^3}\\left(\\mathbf{r}_3-\\mathbf{r}_1\\right)+m_1 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{r}_1=0, \\\\ -\\left(G \\frac{m_1}{a^3}+G \\frac{m_2}{a^3} G \\frac{m_3}{a^3}\\right) m_1 \\mathbf{r}_1+m_1 \\omega^2 \\mathbf{r}_1=0, \\\\ \\frac{G M}{a^3}=\\omega^2 . \\end{gathered} $  This is the condition $\\omega^2 a^3=G M$. The same condition is got in result of similar calculations for the points $\\mathrm{P}_2$ and $\\mathrm{P}_3$. The method described here does not differ essentially from the first method. In fact they are slight modifications of each other. However, it is interesting to notice how application of a proper mathematical language, e.g. the vector product, simplifies the calculations.  The relation $\\omega^2 a^3=G M$ can be called a \"generalized Kepler's law\" as, in fact, it is very similar to the Kepler's law but with respect to the many-body system.

        "solution": "At the beginning one should notice that the kinetic energy of the electron accelerated with the potential difference $U=511 \\mathrm{kV}$ equals to its rest energy $E_0$. Therefore, at least in the case of the electron, the laws of the classical physics cannot be applied. It is necessary to use relativistic laws.  The relativistic equation of motion of a particle with the charge $e$ in the magnetic field B has the following form: $ \\frac{d}{d t} \\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{F}_L $ where $\\mathbf{p}=m_0 \\gamma$ denotes the momentum of the particle (vector) and $ \\mathbf{F}_L=e \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} $ is the Lorentz force (its value is $e v B$ and its direction is determined with the right hand rule). $m_0$ denotes the (rest) mass of the particle and $v$ denotes the velocity of the particle. The quantity $\\gamma$ is given by the formula: $ \\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $  The Lorentz force $\\mathbf{F}_L$ is perpendicular to the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ of the particle and to its momentum $\\mathbf{p}=m_0 \\gamma \\mathbf{v}$. Hence, $ \\mathbf{F}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{F}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{p}=0 $  Multiplying the equation of motion by $\\mathbf{p}$ and making use of the hint given in the text of the problem, we get: $ \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{d t} p^2=0 $  It means that the value of the particle momentum (and the value of the velocity) is constant during the motion: $ p=m_0 v \\gamma=\\text { const; } \\quad v=\\text { const. } $  The same result can be obtained without any formulae in the following way: The Lorentz force $\\mathbf{F}_L$ is perpendicular to the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ (and to the momentum $p$ as $\\mathbf{p}=m_0 \\boldsymbol{\\mathcal { N }}$ ) and, as a consequence, to the trajectory of the particle. Therefore, there is no force that could change the component of the momentum tangent to the trajectory. Thus, this component, whose value is equal to the length of $\\mathbf{p}$, should be constant: $\\mathbf{p}=$ const. (The same refers to the component of the velocity tangent to the trajectory as $\\mathbf{p}=m_0 \\boldsymbol{N}$ ).  Let $s$ denotes the path passed by the particle along the trajectory. From the definition of the velocity, we have: $ \\frac{d s}{d t}=v $ Using this formula, we can rewrite the equation of motion as follows: $ \\begin{gathered} v \\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{p}=\\frac{d s}{d t} \\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{p}=\\frac{d}{d t} \\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{F}_L, \\\\ \\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_L}{v} . \\end{gathered} $  Dividing this equation by $p$ and making use of the fact that $p=$ const, we obtain: $ v \\frac{d}{d s} \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_L}{v p} $ and hence $ \\frac{d}{d s} \\mathbf{t}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_L}{v p} $ where $\\mathbf{t}=\\mathbf{p} / p=\\mathbf{v} / v$ is the versor (unit vector) tangent to the trajectory. The above equation is exactly the same for both electrons and protons if and only if the vector quantity: $ \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_L}{v p} $ is the same in both cases. Denoting corresponding quantities for protons with the same symbols as for the electrons, but with primes, one gets that the condition, under which both electrons and protons can move along the same trajectory, is equivalent to the equality: $ \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_L}{v p}=\\frac{\\mathbf{F}_L^{\\prime}}{v^{\\prime} p^{\\prime}} . $  However, the Lorentz force is proportional to the value of the velocity of the particle, and the directions of any two vectors of the following three: $\\mathbf{t}$ (or $\\mathbf{v}$ ), $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{L}}, \\mathbf{B}$ determine the direction of the third of them (right hand rule). Therefore, the above condition can be written in the following form: $ \\frac{e \\mathbf{B}}{p}=\\frac{e^{\\prime} \\mathbf{B}^{\\prime}}{p^{\\prime}} . $  Hence, $ \\mathbf{B}^{\\prime}=\\frac{e}{e^{\\prime}} \\frac{p^{\\prime}}{p} \\mathbf{B}=\\frac{p^{\\prime}}{p} \\mathbf{B} . $  This means that at any point the direction of the field $\\mathbf{B}$ should be conserved, its orientation should be changed into the opposite one, and the value of the field should be multiplied by the same factor $p^{\\prime} / p$. The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is a vector sum of the magnetic fields of the coils that are arbitrarily distributed in the space. Therefore, each of this fields should be scaled with the same factor $-p^{\\prime} / p$. However, the magnetic field of any coil is proportional to the current flowing in it. This means that the required scaling of the fields can only be achieved by the scaling of all the currents with the same factor $-p^{\\prime} / p$ : $ i_n^{\\prime}=-\\frac{p^{\\prime}}{p} i_n . $  Now we shall determine the ratio $p^{\\prime} / p$. The kinetic energies of the particles in both cases are the same; they are equal to $E_k=e|U|=511 \\mathrm{keV}$. The general relativistic relation between the total energy $E$ of the particle with the rest energy $E_0$ and its momentum $p$ has the following form: $ E^2=E_0^2+p^2 c^2 $ where $\\mathrm{c}$ denotes the velocity of light. The total energy of considered particles is equal to the sum of their rest and kinetic energies: $ E=E_0+E_k . $  Using these formulae and knowing that in our case $E_k=e|U|=E_e$, we determine the momenta of the electrons $(p)$ and the protons $\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right)$. We get: a) electrons: $ \\begin{gathered} \\left(E_e+E_e\\right)^2=E_e^2+p^2 c^2, \\\\ p=\\frac{E_e}{c} \\sqrt{3} . \\end{gathered} $ b) protons $ \\left(E_p+E_e\\right)^2=E_p^2+p^{\\prime 2} c^2 $ $ p^{\\prime}=\\frac{E_e}{c} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{E_p}{E_e}+1\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{E_p}{E_e}\\right)^2} . $  Hence, $ \\frac{p^{\\prime}}{p}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{E_p}{E}+1\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{E_p}{E_e}\\right)^2} \\approx 35.0 $ and $ i_n^{\\prime}=-35.0 i_n . $  It is worthwhile to notice that our protons are 'almost classical', because their kinetic energy $E_k\\left(=E_e\\right)$ is small compared to the proton rest energy $E_p$. Thus, one can expect that the momentum of the proton can be determined, with a good accuracy, from the classical considerations. We have: $ \\begin{gathered} E_e=E_k=\\frac{p^{\\prime 2}}{2 m_p}=\\frac{p^{\\prime 2} c^2}{2 m_p c^2}=\\frac{p^{\\prime 2} c^2}{2 E_p}, \\\\ p^{\\prime}=\\frac{1}{c} \\sqrt{2 E_e E_p} . \\end{gathered} $  On the other hand, the momentum of the proton determined from the relativistic formulae can be written in a simpler form since $E_{\\mathrm{p}} / E_{\\mathrm{e}}$ \u00bb 1 . We get: $ p^{\\prime}=\\frac{E_e}{c} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{E_p}{E_e}+1\\right)^2-\\left(\\frac{E_p}{E_e}\\right)^2}=\\frac{E_e}{c} \\sqrt{2 \\frac{E_p}{E_e}+1} \\approx \\frac{E_e}{c} \\sqrt{2 \\frac{E_p}{E_e}}=\\frac{1}{c} \\sqrt{2 E_e E_p} . $  In accordance with our expectations, we have obtained the same result as above.",

        "solution": "a) By the moment of releasing the bar the carriage has a velocity $v_0$ relative to the table and continues to move at the same velocity.  The bar, influenced by the friction force $F_{\\mathrm{fr}}=\\mu m g$ from the carriage, gets an acceleration $a=F_{\\mathrm{fr}} / M=\\mu m g / M ; \\quad a=0.02 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, while the velocity of the bar changes with time according to the law $v_{\\mathrm{b}}=a t$.  Since the bar can not move faster than the carriage then at a moment of time $t=t_0 \\quad$ its sliding will stop, that is $v_b=v_0$. Let us determine this moment of time: $ t_0=\\frac{v_0}{a}=\\frac{v_0 M}{\\mu m g}=5 \\mathrm{~s} $  By that moment the displacement of the $S b$ bar and the carriage $S c$ relative to the table will be equal to $ S_{\\mathrm{c}}=v_0 t_0=\\frac{v_0^2 M}{\\mu m g}, \\quad S_b=\\frac{a t_0^2}{2}=\\frac{v_0^2 M}{2 \\mu m g} . $  The displacement of the carriage relative to the bar is equal to $ S=S_c-S_b=\\frac{v_0^2 M}{2 \\mu m g}=0.25 \\mathrm{~m} $  Since $S<l$, the carriage will not reach the edge of the bar until the bar is stopped by an immovable support. The distance to the support is not indicated in the problem condition so we can not calculate this time. Thus, the carriage is moving evenly at the velocity $v_0=0.1 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, whereas the bar is moving for the first $5 \\mathrm{sec}$ uniformly accelerated with an acceleration $a=0.02 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ and then the bar is moving with constant velocity together with the carriage. b) Since there is no friction between the bar and the table surface the system of the bodies \"bar-carriage\" is a closed one. For this system one can apply the law of conservation of momentum: $ m v+M u=m v_0 $ where $v$ and $u$ are projections of velocities of the carriage and the bar relative to the table onto the horizontal axis directed along the vector of the velocity $v_0$. The velocity of the thread winding $v_0$ is equal to the velocity of the carriage relative to the bar $(v-u)$(1), that is $ v_0=v-u $(2)  Solving the system of equations (1) and (2) we obtain: $ u=0, v=v_0 . $ Thus, being released the bar remains fixed relative to the table, whereas the carriage will be moving with the same velocity $v_0$ and will reach the edge of the bar within the time $t$ equal to $ t=l / v_0=5 \\mathrm{~s} \\text {. } $",

Since the sum of the lengths of its two other sides exceeds the length of its third side, $A B+B O>O A=R$, hence $B O>R / 2$. This means that a ray parallel to the main optical axis of the spherical mirror and passing not too close to it, after having been reflected, crosses the main optical axis at the point $B$ lying between the focus $F$ and the mirror. The focal surface is erossed by this ray at the point $C$ which is at a certain distance $C F=\\mathrm{r}$ from the main focus.  Thus, when reflecting a parallel beam of rays by a spherical mirror finite in size it does not join at the focus of the mirror but forms a beam with radius $r$ on the focal plane. From $\\triangle B F C$ we can write : $ r=B F \\operatorname{tg} \\beta=B F \\operatorname{tg} 2 \\alpha, $ where $\\alpha$ is the maximum angle of incidence of the extreme ray onto the mirror, while $\\sin \\alpha=D / 2 R$ : $ B F=B O-O F=\\frac{R}{2 \\cos \\alpha}-\\frac{R}{2}=\\frac{R}{2} \\frac{1-\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\alpha} . $  Thus, $r=\\frac{R}{2} \\frac{1-\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\alpha} \\frac{\\sin 2 \\alpha}{\\cos 2 \\alpha}$. Let us express the values of $\\cos \\alpha, \\sin 2 \\alpha, \\cos 2 \\alpha$ via $\\sin \\alpha$ taking into account the small value of the angle $\\alpha$ : $   \\cos \\alpha=\\sqrt{1-\\sin ^2 \\alpha} \\approx 1-\\frac{\\sin ^2 \\alpha}{2}, \\\\  \\sin 2 \\alpha=2 \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\alpha, \\\\  \\cos 2 \\alpha=\\cos ^2 \\alpha-\\sin ^2 \\alpha=1-2 \\sin ^2 \\alpha .  $  Then $ r=\\frac{R}{2} \\frac{\\sin ^3 \\alpha}{1-2 \\sin ^2 \\alpha} \\approx \\frac{R}{2} \\sin ^3 \\alpha \\approx \\frac{D^3}{16 R^2} . $  Substituting numerical data we will obtain: $\\mathrm{r} \\approx 1.95 \\cdot 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~m} \\approx 2 \\mathrm{~mm}$.  From the expression $D=\\sqrt[3]{16 R^2 r}$ one can see that if the radius of the receiver is decreased 8 times the transversal diameter $D^{\\prime}$ of the mirror, from which the light comes to the receiver, will be decreased 2 times and thus the \"effective\" area of the mirror will be decreased 4 times.  The radiation flux $\\Phi$ reflected by the mirror and received by the receiver will also be decreased twice since $\\Phi \\sim S$.",

One only needs to realize that the rate of flow of charge into the amplifier is divided into a rate of charging of the capacitor, $C d V / d t$, and a conduction current, $V / R$, through the resistor. There are then two extreme situations, depending on whether the amount of charge lost by leakage during one quarter-period is small or large compared to $C V$. (a) If $C V \u00bb(V / R) \\times(T / 4)$-- i.e., $T=T_a$ \u00ab $C R$-- very little of the charge is carried away through $R$ during the time $T / 4$. Thus, when the insulated quadrants are charged negatively through induction, an almost equal positive charge is given to $C$. Thus $V(t)$ rises almost linearly with $t$ between $t=0$ and $t=T / 4$, and then decreases almost linearly by an equal $ V_{\\max .}=V_a \\approx \\frac{\\left|q_{\\max .}\\right|}{C}, $ where $q_{\\max }$ has the value obtained in part 4.* ###img_1### (b) If, however, $T=T_b \\gg C R$-- i.e., $C R \\backsim T_b$ - most of the charge is quickly carried away through $R$. A constant positive current flows through $R$ when the magnitude of $q$ is increasing, and an equal negative current when the magnitude of $q$ is decreasing. The size of this current is approximately equal to $\\mid q_{\\max } . V\\left(T_b / 4\\right)$. The resulting voltage across $R$ is approximately constant during each quarter-period, and is alternately positive and negative. In this case, $ V_{\\max .}=V_b \\approx \\frac{4 q_{\\max } \\cdot R}{T_b} . $  Putting these results together, we see that: $\\frac{V_a}{V_b} \\approx \\frac{T_b}{4 C R}$. *Note: Ultimately (unless $C R$ is infinite) the form of $V_a$ will become a sawtooth varying symmetrically between $\\pm q_{\\max } / 2 C$.

To analyze this, consider the momentum changes of the laser light incident on the upper half of the prism.

If the energy of a photon is $E$, then its momentum is $\\vec{p}_i=\\frac{E}{c} \\hat{i}$, and a photon leaving the prism at an angle $\\theta$ to the $x$ axis will differ in momentum from the incident photon by $ \\delta \\vec{p}=\\frac{E}{c}(\\cos \\theta-1) \\hat{i}-\\frac{E}{c} \\sin \\theta \\hat{j} . $  The rate of charge of momentum of these photons will then be $ \\bar{F}_{\\mathrm{up}}=r_{\\mathrm{u}} \\delta \\vec{p}=\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{u}} E}{c}[(\\cos \\theta-1) \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}-\\sin \\theta \\quad j .] $ ###img_1### ###img_2### The quantity $\\tau_u E$ is the power $P_u$ delivered to the upper face, and the recoil force $\\vec{F}_u$ produced by light refracting through the upper half of the prism will be $ \\vec{F}_u=\\frac{P_u}{c}[(1-\\cos \\theta) i+\\sin \\theta j] . $  A similar argument gives the force on the lower half as $ \\vec{F}_l=\\frac{P_l}{c}[(1-\\cos \\theta) \\hat{i}-\\sin \\theta \\hat{j}] . $  From these two results we see that the net force on the prism will be $ \\vec{F}=\\frac{1}{c}\\left[\\left(P_u+P_l\\right)(1-\\cos \\theta)\\right] i+\\frac{1}{c}\\left[\\left(P_u-P_l\\right) \\sin \\theta\\right] j . $  The angle $\\theta$ can be expressed in terms of $\\alpha$ (see answer to part 1 ). To find the values of $P_u$ and $P_l$ calculate the average intensities, $\\bar{I}_u$ and $\\bar{I}_l$, incident on each half of the prism and multiply by $h w$, the area of each half of the prism projected perpendicular to the laser beam. Because the intensity distribution $I(y)$ is a linear function of $y$, the average intensities are easily determined. The problem states that $  I(y)  =I_0\\left(1-\\frac{y}{4 h}\\right)   \\text { for } 0<y<+4 h \\\\  =I_0\\left(1+\\frac{y}{4 h}\\right)   \\text { for }-4 h<y<0 .  $ Now suppose that the prism is lifted a distance $y_0$ from the $x$ axis $\\left(y_0>0\\right)$. There are two distinct cases: (a) When $h \\leq y_0 \\leq 3 h$, the whole prism is entirely in the upper half of the beam. As ###img_1### shows, for this case the average is equal to the intensity at the zenter of each face which is at $y_0+h / 2$ for the upper face and at $y_0-h / 2$ for the lower one. This gives $   \\bar{I}_u=I_0\\left(1-\\frac{y_0+h / 2}{4 h}\\right)=I_0\\left(\\frac{7}{8}-\\frac{y_0}{4 h}\\right) \\\\  \\bar{I}_l=I_0\\left(1-\\frac{y_0-h / 2}{4 h}\\right)=I_0\\left(\\frac{9}{8}-\\frac{y_0}{4 h}\\right)  $  From these it follows that $ \\begin{gathered} F_x=\\frac{2 h w I_0}{c}\\left(1-\\frac{y_0}{4 h}\\right)(1-\\cos \\theta) \\\\ F_y=-\\frac{h w I_0}{4 c} \\sin \\theta . \\\\ 90 \\end{gathered} $ (b) When $0<y_0<h$, the lower half of the prism is partly in the lower half of the laser beam as shown in ###img_2###. Then the part of the lower half of the prism between 0 and $y_0$ has a fraction $y_0 / h$ of the area of the lower half of the prism and sees an average intensity $ \\bar{I}_{l_1}=I\\left(y_0 / 2\\right)=I_0\\left(1-\\frac{y_0}{8 h}\\right) . $  The part between 0 and $y_0-h$ has a fraction $1-y_0 / h$ of the area and sees an average intensity of $ \\bar{I}_{l_2}=I\\left(\\frac{h-y_0}{2}\\right)=I_0\\left(\\frac{7}{8}+\\frac{y_0}{8 h}\\right) . $  Putting these together we get $  P_l  =h w \\frac{y_0}{h} \\bar{I}_{\\ell_1}+h w\\left(1-\\frac{y_0}{h}\\right) \\bar{I}_{l_2} \\\\  =h w I_0\\left(\\frac{7}{8}+\\frac{y_0}{4 h}-\\frac{y_0^2}{4 h^2}\\right) .  $  The average intensity on the upper face has the same functional dependence on $y_0$ as in the first case. Therefore, $P_u=h w I_0\\left(\\frac{7}{8}-\\frac{y 0}{4 h}\\right)$ as before. Putting these together gives $   P_u+P_l=h w I_0\\left(\\frac{7}{4}-\\frac{y_0^2}{4 h^2}\\right) \\\\  P_u-P_l=-h w I_0 \\frac{y_0}{2 h}\\left(1-\\frac{y_0}{2 h}\\right)  $ from which it follows that $   F_x=\\frac{h w I_0}{c}\\left(\\frac{7}{4}-\\frac{y_0^2}{4 h^2}\\right)(1-\\cos \\theta) \\\\  F_y=-\\frac{h w I_0}{c} \\frac{y_0}{2 h}\\left(1-\\frac{y_0}{2 h}\\right) \\sin \\theta .  $  Because the intensity distribution is symmetric about the axis of the laser beam, the solutions for $y_0<0$ will mirror the solutions for $y_0>0$. Graphs of the $F_x$ and $F_y$ as functions of $y_0$ are shown in ###img_3###.",

For the self-sustained gas discharge there are two important processes not considered above. The first process isasecondary electron emission, and the second one isa formation of electron avalanche. The secondary electron emission occurs when ions hit on the negative electrode, called a cathode, and the electrons are knocked out of it to move towards the positive electrode, called an anode.

A potential difference $V$ is maintained between them. The plates are mutually parallel and co-axial, however their axis is perpendicular to the magnetic field. A photographic film, covers the inside of the curved surface of a cylinder of radius $\\rho+s$, which is held co-axial with the plates. In other words, the film is at a radial distance $s$ from the edges of the plates. The entire arrangement is placed in vacuo. Note that $t$ is very much smaller than both $s$ and $\\rho$.  A point source of $\\beta$ particles, which emits the $\\beta$ particles uniformly in all directions with a range of velocities, is placed between the centres of the plates, and the same piece of film is exposed under three different conditions: firstly with $\\quad B=0$, and $V=0$, secondly with $B=B_0$, and $V=V_0$, and thirdly with $\\quad B=-B_0$, and $V=-V_0$; where $V_0$ and $B_0$ are positive constants. Please note that the upper plate is positively charged when $V>0$ (negative when $V<0$ ), and that the magnetic field is in the direction defined by figure 2.5 when $B>0$ (in the opposite direction when $B<0$ ). For this part you may assume the gap is negligibly small.  Two regions of the film are labelled A and B on figure 2.5. After exposure and development, a sketch of one of these regions is given in figure 2.6. From which region was this piece taken (on your answer sheet write A or B)?

Since the glass wall is very thin we can assume that the rays leaving the aquarium refract as if there was water - air interface. The divergent rays undergoing one single refraction, as show in Fig. 4.1, form the first, virtual, image of the fish. The corresponding vertical displacement $A_1 B_1$ of that image is equal to the distance $d_1$ between the optical axis $a$ and the ray $b_1$, which leaves the aquarium parallel to $a$. Since distances $d$ and $d_1$ are small compared to $R$ we can use the small-angle approximation: $\\sin \\alpha \\approx \\tan \\alpha \\approx \\alpha$ (rad). Thus we obtain: $   d_1 \\approx R \\alpha ; \\\\  d \\approx R \\gamma ; \\\\  \\alpha+\\gamma=2 \\beta ; \\\\  \\alpha \\approx n \\beta .  $  From above equations we find the vertical displacement of the first image in terms of $d$ : $ d_1=\\frac{n}{2-n} d, $ and respectively its velocity $v_1$ in terms of $v$ : $ v_1=\\frac{n}{2-n}=2 v . $ The rays, which are first reflected by the mirror, and then are refracted twice at the walls of the aquarium form the second, real image (see Fig. 4.2). It can be considered as originating from the mirror image of the fish, which move along the line $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$ at exactly the same distance $d$ as the fish do. The vertical displacement $A_2 B_2$ of the second image is equal to the distance $d_2$ between the optical axis $a$ and the ray $b_2$, which is parallel to $a$. Again, using the small-angle approximation we have: $   d^{\\prime} \\approx 4 R \\delta-d, \\\\  d_2 \\approx R \\alpha  $  Following the derivation of equation $d_1=\\frac{n}{2-n} d$ we obtain: $ d_2=\\frac{n}{2-n} d^{\\prime} . $  Now using the exact geometric relations: $ \\delta=2 \\alpha-2 \\beta $ and the Snell's law $\\alpha \\approx n \\beta$ in a small-angle limit, we finally express $d_2$ in terms of $d$ : $ d_2=\\frac{n}{9 n-10} d $ and the velocity $v_2$ of the second image in terms of $v$ : $ v_2=\\frac{n}{9 n-10} v=\\frac{2}{3} v . $  The relative velocity of the two images is: $ \\mathbf{v}_{\\text {rel }}=\\mathbf{v}_1-\\mathbf{v}_2 $ in a vector form. Since vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$ are oppositely directed (one of the images moves upward, the other, downward) the magnitude of the relative velocity is: $ v_{\\text {rel }}=v_1+v_2=\\frac{8}{3} v \\text {. } $",

The subscript following $\\lambda$ (or $v$ ) can be either 1 or 2 , with number 1 corresponding to lowest velocity of the ion and number 2 the highest velocity of the ion. When no accelerating voltage is applied, the subscript 1 implies that minimum velocity of the ion is 0 , and the highest velocity of the ion is $6000 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. If accelerating voltage $U$ is applied, number 1 indicates that the wavelength of laser light pertains to the ion of lowest velocity and number 2 indicates the ion of the highest velocity.

Equation $\\lambda_L-\\lambda_H=\\frac{V}{v^*}$ may be rewritten in the context of the applications of accelerating voltage in order for the two spectra of laser light will not overlap as follows: $\\lambda_L^{(N)^{\\prime}}-\\lambda_H^{(N)^{\\prime}}=\\frac{v^{\\prime}}{v^*}$ where $\\mathrm{N}$ is the order of the energy level The subscript $\\mathrm{L}$ relates $\\lambda$ to lowest velocity of the ion which \"sees\" frequency $v^*$. The lowest velocity in this case is $\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{e} \\cdot \\mathrm{U}}{\\mathrm{m}}}$ and the subscript $\\mathrm{H}$ relates $\\lambda$ to the highest velocity of the ion, in this case $\\sqrt{v^2+\\frac{2 \\cdot e \\cdot U}{m}}$.

        "solution": "As regards the text of the problem, the sentence \"The same quantities of heat have been supplied to both balls.\" is not too clear. We will follow intuitive understanding of this sentence, i.e. we will assume that both systems ( $\\mathrm{A}-$ the hanging ball and $\\mathrm{B}$ - the ball resting on the plane) received the same portion of energy from outside. One should realize, however, that it is not the only possible interpretation.  When the balls are warmed up, their mass centers are moving as the radii of the balls are changing. The mass center of the ball A goes down, while the mass center of the ball B goes up. It is shown in Fig. 7 (scale is not conserved).  Displacement of the mass center corresponds to a change of the potential energy of the ball in the gravitational field. In case of the ball $A$ the potential energy decreases. From the $1^{\\text {st }}$ principle of thermodynamics it corresponds to additional heating of the ball.  In case of the ball $B$ the potential energy increases. From the $1^{\\text {st }}$ principle of thermodynamics it corresponds to some \"losses of the heat provided\" for performing a mechanical work necessary to rise the ball. The net result is that the final temperature of the ball B should be lower than the final temperature of the ball $\\mathrm{A}$.  The above effect is very small. For example, one may find (see later) that for balls made of lead, with radius $10 \\mathrm{~cm}$, and portion of heat equal to $50 \\mathrm{kcal}$, the difference of the final temperatures of the balls is of order $10^{-5} \\mathrm{~K}$. For spatial and time fluctuations such small quantity practically cannot be measured. Calculation of the difference of the final temperatures was not required from the participants. Nevertheless, we present it here as an element of discussion.  We may assume that the work against the atmospheric pressure can be neglected. It is obvious that this work is small. Moreover, it is almost the same for both balls. So, it should not affect the difference of the temperatures substantially. We will assume that such quantities as specific heat of lead and coefficient of thermal expansion of lead are constant (i.e. do not depend on temperature). The heat used for changing the temperatures of balls may be written as $ Q_i=m c \\Delta t_i, \\text { where } i=A \\text { or } B, $  Here: $m$ denotes the mass of ball, $c$ - the specific heat of lead and $\\Delta t_i$ - the change of the temperature of ball. The changes of the potential energy of the balls are (neglecting signs): $ \\Delta E_i=m g r \\alpha \\Delta t_i, \\text { where } i=A \\text { or } B . $ Here: $g$ denotes the gravitational acceleration, $r$ - initial radius of the ball, $\\alpha$ - coefficient of thermal expansion of lead. We assume here that the thread does not change its length.  Taking into account conditions described in the text of the problem and the interpretation mentioned at the beginning of the solution, we may write: $   Q=Q_A-A \\Delta E_A, \\text { for the ball } A, \\\\  Q=Q_B+A \\Delta E_B, \\text { for the ball } B .  $ $A$ denotes the thermal equivalent of work: $A \\approx 0.24 \\frac{\\mathrm{cal}}{\\mathrm{J}}$. In fact, $A$ is only a conversion ratio between calories and joules. If you use a system of units in which calories are not present, you may omit $A$ at all. Thus $   Q=(m c-A m g r \\alpha) \\Delta t_A, \\text { for the ball } A, \\\\  Q=(m c+A m g r \\alpha) \\Delta t_B, \\text { for the ball } B  $ and $ \\Delta t_A=\\frac{Q}{m c-A m g r \\alpha}, \\quad \\Delta t_B=\\frac{Q}{m c+A m g r \\alpha} . $  Finally we get $ \\Delta t=\\Delta t_A-\\Delta t_B=\\frac{2 A g r \\alpha}{c^2-(A g r \\alpha)^2} \\frac{Q}{m} \\approx \\frac{2 A Q g r \\alpha}{m c^2} . $ (We neglected the term with $\\alpha^2$ as the coefficient $\\alpha$ is very small.) Now we may put the numerical values: $Q=50 \\mathrm{kcal}, A \\approx 0.24 \\mathrm{cal} / \\mathrm{J}, g \\approx 9.8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2$, $m \\approx 47 \\mathrm{~kg}$ (mass of the lead ball with radius equal to $10 \\mathrm{~cm}$ ), $r=0.1 \\mathrm{~m}, c \\approx 0.031 \\mathrm{cal} /(\\mathrm{g} \\cdot \\mathrm{K})$, $\\alpha \\approx 29 \\cdot 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$.

        "solution": "The water added to the vessel evaporates. Assume that the whole portion of water evaporated. Then the density of water vapor in $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ should be $0.300 \\mathrm{~g} / 1$. It is less than the density of saturated vapor at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ equal to $0.597 \\mathrm{~g} / 1$. (The students were allowed to use physical tables.) So, at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ the vessel contains air and unsaturated water vapor only (without any liquid phase).  Now we assume that both air and unsaturated water vapor behave as ideal gases. In view of Dalton law, the total pressure $p$ in the vessel at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is equal to the sum of partial pressures of the air $p_a$ and unsaturated water vapor $p_v$ : $ p=p_a+p_v . $  As the volume of the vessel is constant, we may apply the Gay-Lussac law to the air. We obtain: $ p_a=p_0\\left(\\frac{273+t}{273}\\right) . $  The pressure of the water vapor may be found from the equation of state of the ideal gas: $ \\frac{p_v V_0}{273+t}=\\frac{m}{\\mu} R, $ where $m$ denotes the mass of the vapor, $\\mu$ - the molecular mass of the water and $R-$ the universal gas constant.

        "solution": " It is possible to make a model of the situation in the problem, considering the Ox axis vertically oriented having the wall in its' lower part. The conservative force $F_x$ could be the weight of the particle. One may present the motion of the particle as the vertical motion of a small elastic ball elastically colliding with the ground and moving with constant friction through the medium. The friction force is smaller than the weight.  The potential energy of the particle can be represented in analogy to the gravitational potential energy of the ball, $m \\cdot g \\cdot h$, considering $m \\cdot g=\\left|F_x\\right| ; h=x$. As is very well known, in the field of a conservative force, the variation of the potential energy depends only on the initial and final positions of the particle, being independent of the path between those positions.  For the situation in the problem, when the particle moves towards the wall, the force acting on it is directed towards the wall and has the modulus I $   F_{\\leftarrow}=\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f \\\\  F_{\\leftarrow}=9 \\mathrm{~N}  $  As a consequence, the motion of the particle towards the wall is a motion with a constant acceleration having the modulus $ a_{\\leftarrow}=\\frac{F_{\\leftarrow}}{m}=\\frac{\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f}{m} $  During the motion, the speed of the particle increases. Hitting the wall, the particle starts moving in opposite direction with a speed equal in modulus with the one it had before the collision.  When the particle moves away from the wall, in the positive direction of the Ox axis, the acting force is again directed towards to the wall and has the magnitude $   F_{\\rightarrow}=\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f \\\\  F_{\\rightarrow}=11 \\mathrm{~N}  $  Correspondingly, the motion of the particle from the wall is slowed down and the magnitude of the acceleration is $ a_{\\rightarrow}=\\frac{F_{\\rightarrow}}{m}=\\frac{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f}{m} $  During this motion, the speed of the particle diminishes to zero. Because during the motion a force acts on the particle, the body cannot have an equilibrium position in any point on axis - the origin making an exception as the potential energy vanishes there. The particle can definitively stop only in this point.  The work of a conservative force from the point having the coordinate $x_0=0$ to the point $x, L_{0 \\rightarrow x}$ is correlated with the variation of the potential energy of the particle $U(x)-U(0)$ as follows $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} U(x)-U(0)=-L_{0 \\rightarrow x} \\\\ U(x)-U(0)=-\\int_0^x \\overrightarrow{F_x} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{d x}=\\int_0^x\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot d x=\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x \\end{array}\\right. $  Admitting that the potential energy of the particle vanishes for $x=0$, the initial potential energy of the particle $U\\left(x_0\\right)$ in the field of conservative force $ F_x(x)=F_0 $ can be written $ U\\left(x_0\\right)=\\left|F_0\\right| \\cdot x_0 $  The initial kinetic energy $E\\left(x_0\\right)$ of the particle is - as given $ E\\left(x_0\\right)=E_c $ and, consequently the total energy of the particle $W\\left(x_0\\right)$ is $ W\\left(x_0\\right)=U\\left(x_0\\right)+E_c $  The draw up of the particle occurs when the total energy of the particle is entirely exhausted by the work of the friction force. The distance covered by the particle before it stops, $D$, obeys $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} W\\left(x_0\\right)=D \\cdot F_f \\\\ U\\left(x_0\\right)+E_c=D \\cdot F_f \\\\ \\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x_0+E_c=D \\cdot F_f \\end{array}\\right. $ so that, $ D=\\frac{\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x_0+E_c}{F_f} $ and $ D=20 \\mathrm{~m} $  The relations $D=\\frac{\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x_0+E_c}{F_f}$ and $D=20 \\mathrm{~m}$ represent the answer to the question I.a.",

        "solution": " During the motion of the particle its energy decrease because of the dissipation work of the friction force. The speed of the particle has a local maximum near the wall. Denoting $v_k$ the speed of the particle just before its' $k^{\\text {th }}$ collision with the wall and $v_{k+1}$ the speed just before its' next collision, $v_k>v_{k+1}$  Among two successive collisions, the particle reaches its' $x_k$ positions in which its' speed vanishes and the energy of the particle is purely potential. These positions are closer and closer to the wall because a part of the energy of the particle is dissipated through friction. $ x_{k+1}<x_k $  Case 1 When the particle moves towards the wall, both its' speed and its' kinetic energy increases. The potential energy of the particle decreases. During the motion - independent of its' direction- energy is dissipated through the friction force.  The potential energy of the particle, $U(x)$, the kinetic energy $E(x)$ and the total energy of the particle during this part of the motion $W(x)$ obey the relation $ W\\left(x_0\\right)-W(x)=F_f \\cdot\\left(x_0-x\\right) $ the position $x$ lying in the domain $ x \\in\\left(0, x_0\\right) $ covered from $x_0$ towards origin. The relation (1.18) can be written as $ \\left[E_c+\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x_0\\right]-\\left[\\frac{m \\cdot v^2}{2}+\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x\\right]=F_f \\cdot\\left(x_0-x\\right) $ so that $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x_0-\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x-F_f \\cdot\\left(x_0-x\\right)\\right] \\\\ v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)-x\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right] \\end{array}\\right. $ and by consequence $ v=-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)-x\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]} $  The minus sign in front of the magnitude of the speed indicates that the motion of the particle occurs into the negative direction of the coordinate axis.  Using the problem data $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} v^2=\\frac{2}{m}(19-9 \\cdot x) \\\\ v=-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(19-9 \\cdot x)} \\end{array}\\right. $  The speed of the particle at the first collision with the wall $v_{1 \\leftarrow}$ can be written as $ v_{1 \\leftarrow}=-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]} $ and has the value $ v_k=-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m} 19} $  The total energy near the wall, purely kinetic $E_{1 \\leftarrow}$, has the expression $ E_{1 \\leftarrow}=E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right) $  The numerical value of this energy is $ E_{1 \\leftarrow}=19 J $  The graph in the ###img_1### gives the dependence on position of the square of the speed for the first part of the particle's motion. The graph in the ###img_2### presents the speed's dependence on the position in this first part of the particle's motion (towards the wall).  After the collision with the wall, the speed of the particle, $v_{1 \\rightarrow}$, has the same magnitude as the speed just before the collision but it is directed in the opposite way. In the graphical representation of the speed as a function of position, the collision with the wall is represented as a jump of the speed from a point lying on negative side of the speed axis to a point lying on positive side of the speed axis. The absolute value of the speed just before and immediately after the collision is the same as represented in the ###img_3###. $ v_{1 \\rightarrow}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]} $  After the first collision, the motion of the particle is slowed down with a constant deceleration $a_{\\rightarrow}$ and an initial speed $v_{1 \\rightarrow}$.  This motion continues to the position $x_1$ where the speed vanishes. From Galileo law it can be inferred that $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} 0=v_{1 \\rightarrow}^2-2 \\cdot a_{\\rightarrow} \\cdot x_1 \\\\ x_1=\\frac{v_{1 \\rightarrow}^2}{2 \\cdot a_{\\rightarrow}}=\\frac{\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]}{2 \\cdot \\frac{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f}{m}}=\\frac{\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f} \\end{array}\\right. $  The numerical value of the position $x_1$ is $ x_1=\\frac{19}{11} m $  For the positions $ x \\in\\left(0, x_1\\right) $ covered from the origin towards $x_1$ the total energy $W(x)$ has the expression $ W(x)=\\frac{m \\cdot v^2}{2}+\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x $  From the wall, the energy of the particle diminishes because of the friction - that is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} E_1 \\leftarrow-W(x)=F_f \\cdot x \\\\ E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)-\\frac{m \\cdot v^2}{2}-\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x=F_f \\cdot x \\end{array}\\right. $  The square of the magnitude of the speed is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)-\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f\\right) \\cdot x\\right] \\\\ v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_1-x\\right) \\end{array}\\right. $ and the speed is $ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)-\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f\\right) \\cdot x\\right]} $ Using the furnished data results $ v^2=\\frac{2}{m}[19-11 \\cdot x] $ and respectively $ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}[19-11 \\cdot x]} $  For the positions lying in the domain $x \\in\\left(0, x_1\\right)$ - (which correspond to a second part of the motion of particle) the ###img_3### gives the dependence of the speed on the position. As can be observed in the figure, after reaching the furthest away position, $x_1$, the particle moves towards the origin, without an initial speed, in an accelerated motion having an acceleration with the magnitude of $a_{\\leftarrow}=\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right) / m$. After the collision with the wall, the particle has a velocity equal in magnitude but opposite in direction with the one it had just before the collision.  When the particle reaches a point in the domain $\\left(0, x_1\\right)$ moving from $x_1$ towards the origin its' total energy $W(x)$ has the expression $W(x)=\\frac{m \\cdot v^2}{2}+\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x$.  Starting from $x_1$, because of the dissipation determined by the friction force, the energy changes to the value corresponding to the position with coordinate $x$. $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x_1-W(x)=F_f \\cdot\\left(x_1-x\\right) \\\\ \\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x_1-\\frac{m \\cdot v^2}{2}-\\left|F_x\\right| \\cdot x=F_f \\cdot\\left(x_1-x\\right) \\end{array}\\right. $  The square of the speed has the expression $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_1-x\\right)\\right] \\\\ v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\frac{\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f}-x\\right] \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right) \\end{array}\\right. $ and the speed is $ v=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\frac{\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f}-x\\right] \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)} $  Using the given data, for a position in the domain $\\left(0, x_1\\right)$ $ v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\frac{19}{11}-x\\right] \\cdot 9 $ respectively $ v=-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\frac{19}{11}-x\\right] \\cdot 9} $  The speed of the particle when it reaches for the second time the wall has - using $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_1-x\\right)\\right] \\\\ v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\frac{\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f}-x\\right] \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\end{array}\\right.$ - the expression $ v_{2 \\leftarrow}=-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}\\left\\{\\frac{\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f} \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right\\}} $  The resulting numerical value is $ v_{2 \\leftarrow}=-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m} \\frac{171}{11}} $ Concluding, after the first collision and first recoil, the particle moves away from the wall, reaches again a position where the speed vanishes and then comes back to the wall. The speed of the particle hitting again the wall is smaller than before - as in the ###img_3###.  As it was denoted before $v_k$ is the speed of the particle just before its' $k$ th run and $x_k$ is the coordinate of the furthest away point reached during the $k$ th run.  The energy of the particle starting from the wall is $ E_k=\\frac{v_k^2 \\cdot m}{2}=W_k(0) $  In the point $x_k$, the furthest away from the origin after $k^{\\text {th }}$ collision, the energy verifies the relation $ U_k=x_k \\cdot\\left|F_x\\right|=W_k\\left(x_k\\right) $  The variation of the energy between starting point and point $x_k$ is $ \\frac{v_k^2 \\cdot m}{2}-x_k \\cdot\\left|F_x\\right|=F_f \\cdot x_k $ so that $ x_k=\\frac{v_k^2 \\cdot m}{2 \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f\\right)} $  After the particle reaches point $x_k$ the direction of the speed changes and, when the particle reaches again the wall $ \\frac{v_{k+1}^2 \\cdot m}{2}=E_{k+1}=W_{k+1}(0) $  The energy conservation law for the $x_k$ point and the state when the particle reaches again the wall gives $ x_k \\cdot\\left|F_x\\right|-\\frac{v_{k+1}^2 \\cdot m}{2}=F_f \\cdot x_k $ so that $ v_{k+1}^2=\\frac{2}{m} x_k\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right) $  Considering $x_k=\\frac{v_k^2 \\cdot m}{2 \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f\\right)}$, the relation $v_{k+1}^2=\\frac{2}{m} x_k\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)$ becomes $ v_{k+1}^2=v_k^2 \\cdot \\frac{\\left|F_x\\right|-F}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F} $  Between two consequent collisions the speed diminishes in a geometrical progression having the ratio $q$. This ratio has the expression $ q=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left|F_x\\right|-F}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F}} $ and the value $ q=\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{11}} $  For the $k+1$ collision the relation (1.48) becomes $ x_{k+1}=\\frac{v_{k+1}^2 \\cdot m}{2 \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f\\right)} $  Taking into account (1.52), the ratio of the successive extreme positions can be written as $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{x_{k+1}}{x_k}=\\frac{\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f}=q^2 \\\\ x_{k+1}=q^2 \\cdot x_k \\end{array}\\right. $  From the $k$ run towards origin, (analogous to $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_1-x\\right)\\right] \\\\ v^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\frac{\\left[E_c+x_0\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\right]}{\\left|F_x\\right|+F_f}-x\\right] \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)\\end{array}\\right.$), the dependence of the square of the speed on position can be written as $v_{(k, \\leftarrow)}^2$ $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} v_{(k, \\leftarrow)}^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\left(F_x \\mid-F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_k-x\\right)\\right] \\\\ v_{(k, \\leftarrow)}^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\left(F_x \\mid-F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_1 \\cdot q^{2 k}-x\\right)\\right] \\end{array}\\right. $ or, using the data $ v_{(k, \\leftarrow)}^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[9 \\cdot\\left(\\frac{19}{11} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{9}{11}\\right)^k-x\\right)\\right] $  For the $k^{\\text {th }}$ run from the origin (analogous with (1.34)), the dependence on the position of the square of the magnitude of the speed $v_{(k, \\rightarrow)}^2$ can be written as $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} v_{(k, \\rightarrow)}^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\left(F_x \\mid+F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_k-x\\right)\\right] \\\\ v_{(k, \\rightarrow)}^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[\\left(F_x \\mid+F_f\\right) \\cdot\\left(x_1 \\cdot q^{2 k}-x\\right)\\right] \\end{array}\\right. $  Using given data $ v_{(k, \\rightarrow)}^2=\\frac{2}{m}\\left[11 \\cdot\\left(\\frac{19}{11} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{9}{11}\\right)^k-x\\right)\\right] $  The evolution of the square of the speed as function of position is represented in the ###img_4###. And the evolution of the speed as function of position is represented in the ###img_5###. The sum of the progression given in (1.56) gives half of the distance covered by the particle after the first collision. $ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k=x_1 \\frac{1}{1-q^2} $  Considering (1.53) and (1.29) $ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k=\\frac{E_c+x_0 \\cdot\\left(\\left|F_x\\right|-F_f\\right)}{2 \\cdot F_f} $  Numerically, $ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k=\\frac{19}{2} m $  The total covered distance is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} D=2 \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} x_k+x_0 \\\\ D=20 m \\end{array}\\right. $ which is the same with $D=20 \\mathrm{~m}$.

Similar, a complex capacitive reactance $\\overline{X_C}=-\\frac{j}{C \\cdot \\omega}$ is attached to the capacity $C$. A parallel circuit will be characterized by his complex admittance $\\bar{Y}$. The admittance of the AC circuit represented in the figure is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\bar{Y}=\\frac{1}{R}+\\frac{1}{L_1 \\cdot \\omega \\cdot j}+\\frac{1}{L_2 \\cdot \\omega \\cdot j}-\\frac{C_1 \\cdot \\omega}{j}-\\frac{C_2 \\cdot \\omega}{j} \\\\ \\bar{Y}=\\frac{1}{R}+j \\cdot\\left[\\left(C_1+C_2\\right)-\\left(\\frac{1}{L_1}+\\frac{1}{L_2}\\right)\\right] \\end{array}\\right. $  The circuit behave as if has a parallel equivalent capacity $C$ $ C=C_1+C_2 $ and a parallel equivalent inductance $L$ $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{1}{L}=\\frac{1}{L_1}+\\frac{1}{L_2} \\\\ L=\\frac{L_1 L_2}{L_1+L_2} \\end{array}\\right. $  The complex admittance of the circuit may be written as $ \\bar{Y}=\\frac{1}{R}+j \\cdot\\left(C \\cdot \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega}\\right) $ and the complex impedance of the circuit will be $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\bar{Z}=\\frac{1}{\\bar{Y}} \\\\ \\bar{Z}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{R}+j \\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega}-C \\cdot \\omega\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^2+\\left(C \\cdot \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega}\\right)^2}} \\end{array}\\right. $  The impedance $Z$ of the circuit, the inverse of the admittance of the circuit $Y$ is the modulus of the complex impedance $\\bar{Z}$ $ Z=|\\bar{Z}|=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^2+\\left(C \\cdot \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega}\\right)^2}}=\\frac{1}{Y} $  The constant current source supplying the circuit furnish a current having a momentary value $i(t)$ $ i(t)=I \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t) $ where $I$ is the effective intensity (constant), of the current and $\\omega$ is the current pulsation (that can vary). The potential difference at the jacks of the circuit has the momentary value $u(t)$ $ u(t)=U \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t+\\varphi) $ where $U$ is the effective value of the tension and $\\varphi$ is the phase difference between tension and current.  The effective values of the current and tension obey the relation $ U=I \\cdot Z $  The active power in the circuit is $ P=\\frac{U^2}{R}=\\frac{Z^2 \\cdot l^2}{R} $  Because as in the enounce, $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} I=\\text { constant } \\\\ R=\\text { constant } \\end{array}\\right. $ the maximal active power is realized for the maximum value of the impedance that is the minimal value of the admittance .  The admittance $ Y=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R}\\right)^2+\\left(C \\cdot \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega}\\right)^2} $ has- as function of the pulsation $\\omega$ - an \"the smallest value\" $ Y_{\\text {min }}=\\frac{1}{R} $ for the pulsation $ \\omega_m=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L \\cdot C}} $ In this case $ \\left(C \\cdot \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega}\\right)=0 \\text {. } $  So, the minimal active power in the circuit has the value $ P_m=R \\cdot I^2 $ and occurs in the situation of alternative current furnished by the source at the frequency $f_m$ $ f_m=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\omega_m=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\cdot \\sqrt{C \\cdot L}} $  To ensure that the active power is half of the maximum power it is necessary that $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} P=\\frac{1}{2} P_m \\\\ \\frac{Z^2 \\cdot l^2}{R}=\\frac{1}{2} R \\cdot l^2 \\\\ \\frac{2}{R^2}=\\frac{1}{Z^2}=Y^2 \\end{array}\\right. $  That is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{2}{R^2}=\\frac{1}{R^2}+\\left(C \\cdot \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega}\\right)^2 \\\\ \\pm \\frac{1}{R}=C \\cdot \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot \\omega} \\end{array}\\right. $  The pulsation of the current ensuring an active power at half of the maximum power must satisfy one of the equations $ \\omega^2 \\pm \\frac{1}{R \\cdot C} \\omega-\\frac{1}{L \\cdot C}=0 $  The two second degree equation may furnish the four solutions $ \\omega= \\pm \\frac{1}{2 R \\cdot C} \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R \\cdot C}\\right)^2+\\frac{4}{L \\cdot C}} $  Because the pulsation is every time positive, and because $ \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R \\cdot C}\\right)^2+\\frac{4}{L \\cdot C}}>\\frac{1}{R \\cdot C} $ the only two valid solutions are $ \\omega_{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R \\cdot C}\\right)^2+\\frac{4}{L \\cdot C}} \\pm \\frac{1}{2 R \\cdot C} $  It exist two frequencies $f_{ \\pm}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\omega_{ \\pm}$allowing to obtain in the circuit an active power representing half of the maximum power. $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} f_{+}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R \\cdot C}\\right)^2+\\frac{4}{L \\cdot C}}+\\frac{1}{2 R \\cdot C}\\right) \\\\ f_{-}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{R \\cdot C}\\right)^2+\\frac{4}{L \\cdot C}}-\\frac{1}{2 R \\cdot C}\\right) \\end{array}\\right. $  The difference of these frequencies is $ \\Delta f=f_{+}-f_{-}=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\frac{1}{R \\cdot C} $ the bandwidth of the circuit - the frequency interval around the resonance frequency having at the ends a signal representing $1 / \\sqrt{2}$ from the resonance signal. At the ends of the bandwidth the active power reduces at the half of his value at the resonance.  The asked ratio is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{f_m}{\\Delta f}=\\frac{R \\cdot C}{\\sqrt{L \\cdot C}}=R \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{L}} \\\\ \\frac{f_m}{\\Delta f}=R \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(C_1+C_2\\right) \\cdot\\left(L_1+L_2\\right)}{L_1 \\cdot L_2}} \\end{array}\\right. $  Because $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} C=15 \\mathrm{nF} \\\\ L=\\frac{20}{3} \\mathrm{mH} \\end{array}\\right. $ it results that $ \\omega_m=10^5 \\mathrm{rad} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $ and $ \\frac{f_m}{\\Delta f}=R \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{L}}=100 \\times 10^3 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\cdot 15 \\times 10^{-9}}{20 \\times 10^{-3}}}=150 $  The $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{f_m}{\\Delta f}=\\frac{R \\cdot C}{\\sqrt{L \\cdot C}}=R \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{L}} \\\\ \\frac{f_m}{\\Delta f}=R \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(C_1+C_2\\right) \\cdot\\left(L_1+L_2\\right)}{L_1 \\cdot L_2}}\\end{array}\\right.$@",

        "solution": " The fact that immediately after the source is detached it is a current in the coils, allow as to admit that currents dependents on time will continue to flow through the coils. ###img_1### The capacitors will be charged with charges variable in time. The variation of the charges of the capacitors will results in currents flowing through the conductors linking the capacitors in the circuit. The momentary tension on the jacks of the coils and capacitors - identical for all elements in circuit - is also dependent on time. Let's admit that the electrical potential of the points $C$ and $D$ is $u(t)$ and the potential of the points $A$ and $B$ is zero. If through the inductance $L_1$ passes the variable current having the momentary value $i_1(t)$, the relation between the current and potentials is $ u(t)-L_1 \\frac{d i_1}{d t}=0 $  The current passing through the second inductance $i_2(t)$ has the expression, $ u(t)-L_2 \\frac{d i_2}{d t}=0 $  If on the positive plate of the capacitor having the capacity $C_1$ is stocked the charge $q_1(t)$, then at the jacks of the capacitor the electrical tension is $u(t)$ and $ q_1=C_1 \\cdot u $  Deriving this relation it results $ \\frac{d q_1}{d t}=C_1 \\cdot \\frac{d u}{d t} $  But $ \\frac{d q_1}{d t}=-i_3 $ because the electrical current appears because of the diminishing of the electrical charge on capacitor plate. Consequently $ i_3=-C_1 \\cdot \\frac{d u}{d t} $  Analogous, for the other capacitor, $ i_4=-C_4 \\cdot \\frac{d u}{d t} $  Considering all obtained results $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{d i_1}{d t}=\\frac{u}{L_1} \\\\ \\frac{d i_2}{d t}=\\frac{u}{L_2} \\end{array}\\right. $ respectively $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{d i_3}{d t}=-C_1 \\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2} \\\\ \\frac{d i_4}{d t}=C_2 \\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2} \\end{array}\\right. $  Denoting $i_5(t)$ the momentary intensity of the current flowing from point $B$ to the point $A$, then the same momentary intensity has the current through the points $C$ and $D$. For the point $A$ the Kirchhoff rule of the currents gives $ i_1+i_5=i_3 $  For $B$ point the same rule produces $ i_4+i_5=i_2 $ Considering $i_1+i_5=i_3$ and $i_4+i_5=i_2$ results $ i_1-i_3=i_4-i_2 $ and deriving $ \\frac{d i_1}{d t}-\\frac{d i_3}{d t}=\\frac{d i_4}{d t}-\\frac{d i_2}{d t} $ that is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} -\\frac{u}{L_1}-\\frac{u}{L_2}=C_1 \\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2}+C_2 \\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2} \\\\ -u \\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{L_1}+\\frac{1}{L_2}\\right)=\\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2} \\cdot\\left(C_1+C_2\\right) \\end{array}\\right. $  Using the symbols defined above $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} -\\frac{u}{L}=\\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2} \\cdot C \\\\ \\ddot{u}+\\frac{1}{L C} u=0 \\end{array}\\right. $  Because the tension obeys the relation above, it must have a harmonic dependence on time $u(t)=A \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta)$  The pulsation of the tension is $ \\omega=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L \\cdot C}} $ Taking into account the relations $u(t)=A \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta)$ and $\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\\frac{d i_3}{d t}=-C_1 \\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2} \\\\ \\frac{d i_4}{d t}=C_2 \\frac{d^2 u}{d t^2}\\end{array}\\right.$ it results that $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} i_3=-C_1 \\frac{d}{d t}(A \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta))=-C_1 \\cdot A \\cdot \\omega \\cdot \\cos (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta) \\\\ i_4=-C_2 \\frac{d}{d t}(A \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta))=-C_2 \\cdot A \\cdot \\omega \\cdot \\cos (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta) \\end{array}\\right. $ and $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{d i_1}{d t}=\\frac{u}{L_1}=\\frac{1}{L_1} \\cdot A \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta) \\\\ \\frac{d i_2}{d t}=\\frac{u}{L_2}=\\frac{1}{L_2} \\cdot A \\cdot \\sin (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta) \\end{array}\\right. $  It results that $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} i_1=\\frac{1}{L_1 \\cdot \\omega} \\cdot A \\cdot \\cos (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta)+M \\\\ i_2=\\frac{1}{L_2 \\cdot \\omega} \\cdot A \\cdot \\cos (\\omega \\cdot t+\\delta)+N \\end{array}\\right. $  In the expression above, $A, M, N$ and $\\delta$ are constants that must be determined using initially conditions. It is remarkable that the currents through capacitors are sinusoidal but the currents through the coils are the sum of sinusoidal and constant currents.  In the first moment $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} u(0)=u_0=40 \\mathrm{~V} \\\\ i_1(0)=i_{01}=0,1 \\mathrm{~A} \\\\ i_2(0)=i_{02}=0,2 \\mathrm{~A} \\end{array}\\right. $  Because the values of the inductances and capacities are $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} L_1=0,01 H \\\\ L_2=0,02 H \\\\ C_1=10 n F \\\\ C_2=5 n F \\end{array}\\right. $ the equivalent inductance and capacity is $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\frac{1}{L}=\\frac{1}{L_1}+\\frac{1}{L_2} \\\\ L=\\frac{L_1 \\cdot L_2}{L_1+L_2} \\\\ L=\\frac{2 \\times 10^{-4}}{3 \\times 10^{-2}} H=\\frac{1}{150} H \\end{array}\\right. $ respectively $ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} C=C_1+C_2 \\\\ C=15 n F \\end{array} .\\right. $  From (2.44) results $ \\omega=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{150} \\cdot 15 \\times 10^{-9}}}=10^5 \\mathrm{rad} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $  The value of the pulsation allows calculating the value of the requested frequency $\\mathbf{b}$. This frequency has the value $f$ $ f=\\frac{\\omega}{2 \\pi}=\\frac{10^5}{2 \\pi} H z $",

        "problem": "In physics, whenever we have an equality relation, both sides of the equation should be of the same type i.e. they must have the same dimensions. For example you cannot have a situation where the quantity on the right-hand side of the equation represents a length and the quantity on the left-hand side represents a time interval. Using this fact, sometimes one can nearly deduce the form of a physical relation without solving the problem analytically. For example if we were asked to find the time it takes for an object to fall from a height of $h$ under the influence of a constant gravitational acceleration $g$, we could argue that one only needs to build a quantity representing a time interval, using the quantities $g$ and $h$ and the only possible way of doing this is $T=a(h / g)^{1 / 2}$. Notice that this solution includes an as yet undetermined coefficient $a$ which is dimensionless and thus cannot be determined, using this method. This coefficient can be a number such as $1,1 / 2, \\sqrt{3}, \\pi$, or any other real number. This method of deducing physical relations is called dimensional analysis. In dimensional analysis the dimensionless coefficients are not important and we do not need to write them. Fortunately in most physical problems these coefficients are of the order of 1 and eliminating them does not change the order of magnitude of the physical quantities. Therefore, by applying the dimensional analysis to the above problem, one obtains $T=(h / g)^{1 / 2}$.  Generally, the dimensions of a physical quantity are written in terms of the dimensions of four fundamental quantities: $M$ (mass), $L$ (length), $T$ (time), and $K$ (temperature). The dimensions of an arbitrary quantity, $x$ is denoted by $[x]$. As an example, to express the dimensions of velocity $v$, kinetic energy $E_k$, and heat capacity $C_V$ we write: $[v]=L T^{-1},\\left[E_k\\right]=M L^2 T^{-2},\\left[C_V\\right]=M L^2 T^{-2} K^{-1}$.

It is not easy to realize the binary nature of most of these star systems from Earth, since the distance between the two stars is much less than their distance from us and thus the stars cannot be resolved with telescopes. Therefore, we have to use either photometry or spectrometry to observe the variations in the intensity or the spectrum of a particular star to find out whether it is a binary system or not. If we are exactly on the plane of motion of the two stars, then one star will occult (pass in front of) the other star at certain times and the intensity of the whole system will vary with time from our observation point. These binary systems are called ecliptic binaries. Assume that two stars are moving on circular orbits around their common center of mass with a constant angular speed $\\omega$ and we are exactly on the plane of motion of the binary system. Also assume that the surface temperatures of the stars are $T_1$ and $T_2\\left(T_1>T_2\\right)$, and the corresponding radii are $R_1$ and $R_2\\left(R_1>R_2\\right)$, respectively. The total intensity of light, measured on Earth, is plotted in Figure 1 as a function of time. Careful measurements indicate that the intensities of the incident light from the stars corresponding to the minima are respectively 90 and 63 percent of the maximum intensity, $I_0$, received from both stars $\\left(I_0=4.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^2\\right)$.

Atoms absorb or emit radiation at their certain characteristic wavelengths. Consequently, the observed spectrum of a star contains absorption lines due to the atoms in the star's atmosphere. Sodium has a characteristic yellow line spectrum $\\left(D_1\\right.$ line $)$ with a wavelength $5895.9 \\AA(10 \\AA=1$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ ). We examine the absorption spectrum of atomic Sodium at this wavelength for the binary system of the previous section. The spectrum of the light that we receive from the binary star is Doppler-shifted, because the stars are moving with respect to us. Each star has a different speed. Accordingly the absorption wavelength for each star will be shifted by a different amount. Highly accurate wavelength measurements are required to observe the Doppler shift since the speed of the stars is much less than the speed of light. The speed of the center of mass of the binary system we consider in this problem is much smaller than the orbital velocities of the stars. Hence all the Doppler shifts can be attributed to the orbital velocity of the stars. Table 1 shows the measured spectrum of the stars in the binary system we have observed. Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be the orbital velocity of each star. Find $v_1$ and $v_2$. The speed of light $c=3.0 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. Ignore all relativistic effects.

Of course the cylinder will experience a nett torque when the rod is inclined to the vertical.

It is easy to understand that the trajectory either needs to touch the roof, or start horizontally from the topmost point with the curvature radius equal to $R$. Indeed, if neither were the case, it would be possible to keep the same throwing angle and just reduce the speed a little bit - the stone would still reach the ground without hitting the roof. Further, if it were tangent at the topmost point, the trajectory wouldn't touch nor intersect the roof anywhere else, because the curvature of the parabola has maximum at its topmost point. Then, it would be possible to keep the initial speed constant, and increase slightly the throwing angle (from horizontal to slightly upwards): the new trajectory wouldn't be neither tangent at the top nor touch the roof at any other point; now we can reduce the initial speed as we argued previously.

Indeed, if we can throw over the building, we can hit anything inside by lowering the throwing angle. On the other hand, the boundary of the targetable region needs to touch the building.

With the origin at the top of the building, the intersection points are defined by the following system of equations:\n$$\nx^2+z^2+2 z R=0, \\quad z=\\frac{v_0^2}{2 g}-\\frac{g x^2}{2 v_0^2} .\n$$\n\nUpon eliminating $z$, this becomes a biquadratic equation for $x$ :\n$$\nx^4\\left(\\frac{g}{2 v_0^2}\\right)^2+x^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_0^2}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{v_0^2}{4 g}+R\\right) \\frac{v_0^2}{g}=0 .\n$$\n\nHence the speed by which the real-valued solutions disappear can be found from the condition that the discriminant vanishes:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_0^2}\\right)^2=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{g R}{v_0^2} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{g R}{v_0^2}=2\n$$ Bearing in mind that due to the energy conservation law, at the ground level the squared speed is increased by $4 g R$.

        "solution": " Let us analyse, what would be the change of the magnetic energy when one of the straws is displaced to a small distance. The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\pm \\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\n\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{Q^2}{a^2}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{Q^2}{a^4}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\pi w a^2$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic field. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\Phi}{a^2}$. So, the energy density $w=\\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^2 \\mu_0} \\frac{\\Phi^2}{a^4}$, hence\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\mu_0} \\frac{\\Phi^2}{a^2} \\text {. }\n$$ For the two straws, we have four magnetic charges. The longitudinal (along a straw axis) forces cancel out (the diagonally positioned pairs of same-sign-charges push in opposite directions).

Another method consists of immersing the sphere into a liquid of same refraction index: its surface becomes invisible. A great number of methods can be found. We can start by determining the axis, the line which joins the centers of the sphere and the bubble. The easiest way is to use the \"tumbler-over\" method. If the sphere is placed on a horizontal plane the axis takes up a vertical position. The image of the bubble, seen from both directions along the axis, is a circle. If the sphere is immersed in a liquid of same index of refraction the spherical bubble is practically inside a parallel plate (Fig. 11). Its boundaries can be determined either by a micrometer or using parallel light beams.  Along the axis we have a lens system consisting, of two thick negative lenses. The diameter of the bubble can be determined by several measurements and complicated calculations. If the index of refraction of the glass is known we can fit a plano-concave lens of same index of refraction to the sphere at the end of the axis (Fig. 12). As ABCD forms a parallel plate the diameter of the bubble can be measured using parallel light beams. Focusing a light beam on point $\\mathrm{A}$ of the surface of the sphere (Fig. 13) we get a diverging beam from point $A$ inside the sphere. The rays strike the surface at the other side and illuminate a cap. Measuring the spherical cap we get angle $\\varphi$. Angle $\\psi$ can be obtained in a similar way at point B. From $ \\sin \\varphi=\\frac{r}{R+d} \\text { and } \\sin \\psi=\\frac{r}{R-d} $ we have $ r=2 R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\psi \\sin \\varphi}{\\sin \\psi+\\sin \\varphi}, \\quad d=R \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\psi-\\sin \\varphi}{\\sin \\psi+\\sin \\varphi} . $  The diameter of the bubble can be determined also by the help of X-rays. X-rays are not refracted by glass. They will cast shadows indicating the structure of the body, in our case the position and diameter of the bubble.  We can also determine the moment of inertia with respect to the axis and thus the diameter of the bubble.",

On being heated, the temperature of the superconducting wire increases and it reverts to the resistive normal state. The typical value of $r_n$ is a few ohms. Here we assume it to be $5 \\Omega$. The inductance of a superconducting magnet depends on its size; assume it be $10 \\mathrm{H}$ for the magnet in ###img_1### . The total current $I$ can be changed by adjusting the resistance $R$. This problem will be graded by the plots only! The arrows denote the positive direction of $I, I_1$ and $I_2$. If the total current $I$ and the resistance $r$ of the superconducting switch are controlled to vary with time in the way shown in Figs, $2 \\mathrm{a}$ and $2 \\mathrm{~b}$ respectively, and assuming the currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ flowing through the magnet and the switch respectively are equal at the beginning (###img_2###), how do they vary with time from $t_1$ to $t_4$ ?

A group of physicists from the Institute Laue - Langevin in Grenoble reported ${ }^1$ in 2002 experimental evidence on the behaviour of neutrons in the gravitational field of the Earth. In the experiment, neutrons moving to the right were allowed to fall towards a horizontal crystal surface acting as a neutron mirror, where they bounced back elastically up to the initial height once and again.  The setup of the experiment is sketched in Figure F-1. It consists of the opening W, the neutron mirror M (at height $z=0$ ), the neutron absorber A (at height $z=H$ and with length $L$ ) and the neutron detector $\\mathrm{D}$. The beam of neutrons flies with constant horizontal velocity component $v_x$ from W to D through the cavity between A and M.

It appears that due to the elastic impact of one atom the container receives averaged momentum $ p=2 \\frac{M_0}{N_A} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{3}} $  All calculations are done assuming that the thermal velocities of the atoms are much larger than the velocity of the container and that the movement is described using system connected with the container.  Have in mind that only half of the atoms hit the bottom of the container, the total momentum received by the container is $ p_t=\\frac{1}{2} n N_A p=n M_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{3}} $ and additional increase of the velocity of the container is $ v_2=\\frac{p_t}{M}=n \\frac{M_0}{M} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{3}} . $  Using the formula for the averaged quadratic velocity $ \\sqrt{\\overline{v^2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{3 R T_f}{M_0}} $ as well eq. $T_f=T\\left(\\frac{V}{V_f}\\right)^{\\gamma-1}=\\frac{T}{2^{2 / 3}}=T 2^{-2 / 3}$ for the temperature $T_f$, the final result for $v_2$ is $ v_2=2^{-1 / 3} \\frac{n \\sqrt{M_0 R T}}{M} . $  Therefore the final velocity of the container is $   v=v_1+v_2=\\sqrt{3\\left(1-2^{-2 / 3}\\right) \\frac{m n R T}{\\left(n M_0+M\\right)\\left(m+n M_0+M\\right)}}+2^{-1 / 3} \\frac{n \\sqrt{M_0 R T}}{M} \\approx \\\\  \\approx \\sqrt{3\\left(1-2^{-2 / 3}\\right) \\frac{m n R T}{M(m+M)}}+2^{-1 / 3} \\frac{n \\sqrt{M_0 R T}}{M} .  $",

Thus, the smallest energy necessary for excitation of the hydrogen atom is: $ \\Delta E=E_2-E_1=E_i\\left(1-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)=\\frac{3}{4} E_i . $  During an inelastic collision a part of kinetic energy of the colliding particles is converted into their internal energy. The internal energy of the system of two hydrogen atoms considered in the problem cannot be changed by less than $\\Delta E$. It means that if the kinetic energy of the colliding atoms with respect to their center of mass is less than $\\Delta E$, then the collision must be an elastic one. The value of $v_0$ can be found by considering the critical case, when the kinetic energy of the colliding atoms is equal to the smallest energy of excitation. With respect to the center of mass the atoms move in opposite direction with velocities $\\frac{1}{2} v_0$. Thus $ \\frac{1}{2} m_H\\left(\\frac{1}{2} v_0\\right)^2+\\frac{1}{2} m_H\\left(\\frac{1}{2} v_0\\right)^2=\\frac{3}{4} E_i $ and $ v_0=\\sqrt{\\frac{3 E_i}{m_H}} \\quad\\left(\\approx 6.26 \\cdot 10^4 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}\\right) . $  Consider the case when $v=v_0$. The collision may be elastic or inelastic. When the collision is elastic the atoms remain in their ground states and do not emit radiation. Radiation is possible only when the collision is inelastic. Of course, only the atom excited in the collision can emit the radiation. In principle, the radiation can be emitted in any direction, but according to the text of the problem we have to consider radiation emitted in the direction of the initial velocity and in the opposite direction only. After the inelastic collision both atom are moving (in the laboratory system) with the same velocities equal to $\\frac{1}{2} v_0$. Let $f$ denotes the frequency of radiation emitted by the hydrogen atom in the mass center (i.e. at rest). Because of the Doppler effect, in the laboratory system this frequency is observed as (c denotes the velocity of light): a) $f_1=\\left(1+\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} v_0}{c}\\right) f$ - for radiation emitted in the direction of the initial velocity of the hydrogen atom, b) $f_2=\\left(1-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} v_0}{c}\\right) f$ - for radiation emitted in opposite direction. The arithmetic mean value of these frequencies is equal to $f$. Thus the required ratio is $ \\frac{\\Delta f}{f}=\\frac{f_1-f_2}{f}=\\frac{v_0}{c} \\quad\\left(\\approx 2 \\cdot 10^{-2} \\%\\right) . $  In the above solution we took into account that $v_0 \\ll c$. Otherwise it would be necessary to use relativistic formulae for the Doppler effect. Also we neglected the recoil of atom(s) in the emission process. One should notice that for the visible radiation or radiation not too far from the visible range the recoil cannot change significantly the numerical results for the critical velocity $v_0$ and the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta f}{f}$. The recoil is important for high-energy quanta, but it is not this case.",

It means that at the point $\\mathrm{C}$ the ray must be tangent to the circle. Moreover, the ray that is tangent to the circle at some point must be tangent also at farther points. Therefore, the ray cannot leave the circle (as long as it is inside the plate)! But at the beginning the ray (at the point $\\mathrm{A}$ ) is tangent to the circle. Thus, the ray must propagate along the circle shown in ###img_1 until reaching point $B$ where it leaves the plate.  Already we know that $\\mathrm{A}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{B}=1 \\mathrm{~cm}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{B}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{B}=12 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and from the rectangular triangle $\\mathrm{BB} \\mathrm{O}$ we get $ d=\\mathrm{B}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{O}=\\sqrt{13^2-12^2} \\mathrm{~cm}=5 \\mathrm{~cm} . $  The shape of the trajectory $y(x)$ can be determined also by using more sophisticated calculations. Knowing $\\beta(x)$ we find $\\operatorname{tg} \\beta(x)$ : $ \\operatorname{tg} \\beta(x)=\\frac{R-x}{\\sqrt{R^2-(R-x)^2}} . $  But $\\operatorname{tg} \\beta(x)$ is the derivative of $y(x)$. So, we have $ \\frac{d y}{d x}=\\frac{R-x}{\\sqrt{R^2-(r-x)^2}}=\\frac{d}{d x}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2-(R-x)^2}\\right) . $  Thus $ y=\\sqrt{R^2-(R-x)^2}+\\text { const } $  Value of const can be found from the condition $ y(0)=0 \\text {. } $  Finally: $ y=\\sqrt{R^2-(R-x)^2} \\text {. } $  It means that the ray moves in the plate along to the circle as found previously. Now we will present yet another, already the third, method of proving that the light in the plate must move along the circle. We draw a number of straight lines (inside the plate) close to each other and passing trough the point $(R, 0)$ - ###img_2###. From the formula given in the text of the problem it follows that the refraction index on each of these lines is inversely proportional to the distance to the point $(R, 0)$. Now we draw several arcs with the center at $(R, 0)$. It is obvious that the geometric length of each arc between two lines is proportional to the distance to the point $(R, 0)$.  It follows from the above that the optical path (a product of geometric length and refractive index) along each arc between the two lines (close to each other) is the same for all the arcs.  Assume that at +-certain moment $t$ the wave front reached one of the lines, e.g. the line marked with a black dot in ###img_2###. According to the Huygens principle, the secondary sources on this line emit secondary waves. Their envelope forms the wave front of the real wave at some time $t+\\Delta t$. The wave fronts of secondary waves, shown in ###img_2###, have different geometric radii, but - in view of our previous considerations - their optical radii are exactly the same. It means that at the time $t+\\Delta t$ the new wave front will correspond to one of the lines passing trough $(R, 0)$. At the beginning the wave front of the light coincided with the $x$ axis, it means that inside the plate the light will move along the circle with center at the point $(R, 0)$.",

        "problem": "A scientific expedition stayed on an uninhabited island. The members of the expedition had had some sources of energy, but after some time these sources exhausted. Then they decided to construct an alternative energy source. Unfortunately, the island was very quiet: there were no winds, clouds uniformly covered the sky, the air pressure was constant and the temperatures of air and water in the sea were the same during day and night. Fortunately, they found a source of chemically neutral gas outgoing very slowly from a cavity. The pressure and temperature of the gas are exactly the same as the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere.  The expedition had, however, certain membranes in its equipment. One of them was ideally transparent for gas and ideally non-transparent for air. Another one had an opposite property: it was ideally transparent for air and ideally non-transparent for gas. The members of the expedition had materials and tools that allowed them to make different mechanical devices such as cylinders with pistons, valves etc. They decided to construct an engine by using the gas from the cavity.  Show that there is no theoretical limit on the power of an ideal engine that uses the gas and the membranes considered above.",

        "solution": "Let us construct the device shown in ###img_1###. $\\mathrm{B}_1$ denotes the membrane transparent for the gas from the cavity, but non-transparent for the air, while $\\mathrm{B}_2$ denotes the membrane with opposite property: it is transparent for the air but non-transparent for the gas.  Initially the valve $Z_1$ is open and the valve $Z_2$ is closed. In the initial situation, when we keep the piston at rest, the pressure under the piston is equal to $p_0+p_0$ due to the Dalton law. Let $V_0$ denotes an initial volume of the gas (at pressure $p_0$ ).  Now we close the valve $Z_1$ and allow the gas in the cylinder to expand. During movement of the piston in the downwards direction we obtain certain work performed by excess pressure inside the cylinder with respect to the atmospheric pressure $p_0$. The partial pressure of the gas in the cylinder will be reduced according to the formula $p=p_0 V_0 / V$, where $V$ denotes volume closed by the piston (isothermal process). Due to the membrane $\\mathrm{B}_2$ the partial pressure of the air in the cylinder all the time is $p_0$ and balances the air pressure outside the cylinder. It means that only the gas from the cavity effectively performs the work. Consider the problem of limits for the work that can be performed during isothermal expansion of an initial portion of the gas. Let us analyze the graph of the function $p_0 V_0 / V$ versus $V$ shown in ###img_2###.  It is obvious that the amount of work performed by the gas during isothermal expansion from $V_0$ to $V_k$ is represented by the area under the curve (shown in the graph) from $V_0$ to $V_k$. Of course, the work is proportional to $V_0$. We shall prove that for large enough $V_k$ the work can be arbitrarily large. Consider $V=V_0, 2 V_0, 4 V_0, 8 V_0, 16 V_0, \\ldots$ It is clear that the rectangles I, II, III, ... (see ###img_2###) have the same area and that one may draw arbitrarily large number of such rectangles under the considered curve. It means that during isothermal expansion of a given portion of the gas we may obtain arbitrarily large work (at the cost of the heat taken from sthe urrounding) - it is enough to take $V_k$ large enough.  After reaching $V_k$ we open the valve $\\mathrm{Z}_2$ and move the piston to its initial position without performing any work. The cycle can be repeated as many times as we want.  In the above considerations we focused our attention on the work obtained during one cycle only. We entirely neglected dynamics of the process, while each cycle lasts some time. One may think that - in principle - the length of the cycle increases very rapidly with the effective work we obtain. This would limit the power of the device we consider.  Take, however, into account that, by proper choice of various parameters of the device, the time taken by one cycle can be made small and the initial volume of the gas $V_0$ can be made arbitrarily large (we consider only theoretical possibilities - we neglect practical difficulties entirely). E.g. by taking large size of the membrane $\\mathrm{B}_1$ and large size of the piston we may minimize the time of taking the initial portion of the gas $V_0$ from the cavity and make this portion very great.  In our analysis we neglected all losses, friction, etc. One should remark that there are no theoretical limits for them. These losses, friction etc. can be made negligibly small. The device we analyzed is very interesting: it produces work at cost of heat taken from surrounding without any difference in temperatures. Does this contradict the second law of thermodynamics? No! It is true that there is no temperature difference in the system, but the work of the device makes irreversible changes in the system (mixing of the gas from the cavity and the air).",

They achieve this by bouncing a laser beam on special mirrors deposited on the Moon's surface by astronauts in 1969, and measuring the round travel time of the light (see Figure 1). With these observations, they have directly measured that the Moon is slowly receding from the Earth. That is, the Earth-Moon distance is increasing with time. This is happening because due to tidal torques the Earth is transferring angular momentum to the Moon, see Figure 2. In this problem you will derive the basic parameters of the phenomenon. Let $L_1$ be the present total angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. Now, make the following assumptions: i) $L_1$ is the sum of the rotation of the Earth around its axis and the translation of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth only. ii) The Moon's orbit is circular and the Moon can be taken as a point. iii) The Earth's axis of rotation and the Moon's axis of revolution are parallel. iv) To simplify the calculations, we take the motion to be around the center of the Earth and not the center of mass. Throughout the problem, all moments of inertia, torques and angular momenta are defined around the axis of the Earth. v) Ignore the influence of the Sun. Write down the equation for the present total angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system.

        "problem": "The purpose of this problem is to develop a simple theory to understand the so-called \"laser cooling\" and \"optical molasses\" phenomena. This refers to the cooling of a beam of neutral atoms, typically alkaline, by counterpropagating laser beams with the same frequency. This is part of the Physics Nobel Prize awarded to S. Chu, P. Phillips and C. Cohen-Tannoudji in 1997. The image above shows sodium atoms (the bright spot in the center) trapped at the intersection of three orthogonal pairs of opposing laser beams. The trapping region is called \"optical molasses\" because the dissipative optical force resembles the viscous drag on a body moving through molasses.  In this problem you will analyze the basic phenomenon of the interaction between a photon incident on an atom and the basis of the dissipative mechanism in one dimension. Consider an atom of mass $m$ moving in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$. For simplicity, we shall consider the problem to be one-dimensional, namely, we shall ignore the $y$ and $z$ directions (see figure 1). The atom has two internal energy levels. The energy of the lowest state is considered to be zero and the energy of the excited state to be $\\hbar \\omega_0$, where $\\hbar=h / 2 \\pi$. The atom is initially in the lowest state. A laser beam with frequency $\\omega_L$ in the laboratory is directed in the $-x$ direction and it is incident on the atom. Quantum mechanically the laser is composed of a large number of photons, each with energy $\\hbar \\omega_L$ and momentum $-\\hbar q$. A photon can be absorbed by the atom and later spontaneously emitted; this emission can occur with equal probabilities along the $+x$ and $-x$ directions. Since the atom moves at non-relativistic speeds, $v / c<<1$ (with $c$ the speed of light) keep terms up to first order in this quantity only. Consider also $\\hbar q / m v \\ll 1$, namely, that the momentum of the atom is much larger than the momentum of a single photon. In writing your answers, keep only corrections linear in either of the above quantities. Assume that the laser frequency $\\omega_L$ is tuned such that, as seen by the moving atom, it is in resonance with the internal transition of the atom. Answer the following questions: Write down the resonance condition for the absorption of the photon.",

Thus, the fact that the atom can spontaneously emit a photon in a finite time after absorption, gives as a result that the resonance condition does not have to be obeyed exactly as in the discussion above. That is, the frequency of the laser beams $\\omega_L$ and $\\omega_L^{\\prime}$ may have any value and the absorption-emission process can still occur. These will happen with different (quantum) probabilities and, as one should expect, the maximum probability is found at the exact resonance condition. On the average, the time elapsed between a single process of absorption and emission is called the lifetime of the excited energy level of the atom and it is denoted by $\\Gamma^{-1}$.  Consider a collection of $N$ atoms at rest in the laboratory frame of reference, and a laser beam of frequency $\\omega_L$ incident on them. The atoms absorb and emit continuously such that there is, on average, $N_{e x c}$ atoms in the excited state (and therefore, $N-N_{e x c}$ atoms in the ground state). A quantum mechanical calculation yields the following result: $ N_{e x c}=N \\frac{\\Omega_R^2}{\\left(\\omega_0-\\omega_L\\right)^2+\\frac{\\Gamma^2}{4}+2 \\Omega_R^2} $ where $\\omega_0$ is the resonance frequency of the atomic transition and $\\Omega_R$ is the so-called Rabi frequency; $\\Omega_R^2$ is proportional to the intensity of the laser beam. As mentioned above, you can see that this number is different from zero even if the resonance frequency $\\omega_0$ is different from the frequency of the laser beam $\\omega_L$. An alternative way of expressing the previous result is that the number of absorption-emission processes per unit of time is $N_{e x c} \\Gamma$.  Consider the physical situation depicted in Figure 2, in which two counter propagating laser beams with the same but arbitrary frequency $\\omega_L$ are incident on a gas of $N$ atoms that move in the $+x$ direction with velocity $v$.

An air parcel is a body of air of sufficient dimension, several meters across, to be treated as an independent thermodynamical entity, yet small enough for its temperature to be considered uniform. The vertical motion of an air parcel can be treated as a quasi adiabatic process, i.e. the exchange of heat with the surrounding air is negligible. If the air parcel rises in the atmosphere, it expands and cools. Conversely, if it moves downward, the increasing outside pressure will compress the air inside the parcel and its temperature will increase. As the size of the parcel is not large, the atmospheric pressure at different points on the parcel boundary can be considered to have the same value $p(z)$, with $z$ - the altitude of the parcel center. The temperature in the parcel is uniform and equals to $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$, which is generally different from the temperature of the surrounding air $T(z)$.

At the altitude $z_0$, where $T_{\\text {parcel }}\\left(z_0\\right)=T\\left(z_0\\right)$, the air parcel is in equilibrium. Indeed, in this case the specific mass $\\rho$ of air in the parcel equals $\\rho^{\\prime}$ - that of the surrounding air in the atmosphere. Therefore, the buoyant force of the surrounding air on the parcel equals the weight of the parcel. The resultant of these two forces is zero.  Remember that the temperature of the air parcel $T_{\\text {parcel }}(z)$ is given by (7), in which we can assume approximately $G=\\Gamma$ at any altitude $z$ near $z=z_0$.

The buoyant force is then smaller than the air parcel weight; their resultant is oriented downward and tends to push the parcel away from the equilibrium position (see Figure 1) So the equilibrium of the parcel is unstable, and we found that: An atmosphere with a temperature lapse rate $\\Lambda>\\Gamma$ is unstable. - In an atmosphere with temperature lapse rate $\\Lambda<\\Gamma$, if the air parcel is lifted to a higher position, at altitude $z_0+d$ (with $d>0$ ), $\\quad T_{\\text {parcel }}\\left(z_0+d\\right)<T\\left(z_0+d\\right)$, then $\\rho>\\rho^{\\prime}$.

The buoyant force is then larger than the air parcel weight, their resultant is oriented upward and tends to push the parcel also back to the equilibrium position (see Figure 2).  So the equilibrium of the parcel is stable, and we found that: An atmosphere with a temperature lapse rate $\\Lambda<\\Gamma$ is stable. - In an atmosphere with lapse rate $\\Lambda=\\Gamma$, if the parcel is brought from equilibrium position and put in any other position, it will stay there, the equilibrium is indifferent. $A n$ atmosphere with a temperature lapse rate $\\Lambda=\\Gamma$ is neutral",

Initially the gas temperature is equal to that of the surrounding environment. The gas can be considered as perfect within a good approximation. Let's assume that the cylinder walls (including the bases) have a very low thermal conductivity and capacity, and therefore the heat transfer between gas and environment is very slow, and can be neglected in the solution of this problem.  Through the glass plate we send into the cylinder the light emitted by a constant power laser; this radiation is easily transmitted by air and glass but is completely absorbed by the gas inside the vessel. By absorbing this radiation the molecules reach excited states, where they quickly emit infrared radiation returning in steps to the molecular ground state; this infrared radiation, however, is further absorbed by other molecules and is reflected by the vessel walls, including the glass plate. The energy absorbed from the laser is therefore transferred in a very short time into thermal movement (molecular chaos) and thereafter stays in the gas for a sufficiently long time.

Then the difference in the scale indications $\\Delta F$ could be written as follows: $ \\Delta F=\\Delta F_1-\\Delta F_2=\\Delta V g\\left(\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) $  According to the problem conditions this difference should be distinguished, i.e. $\\Delta F \\geq m_0 g$ or $\\Delta V g\\left(\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}\\right) \\geq m_0$, wherefrom $ \\Delta V \\geq \\frac{m_0}{\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}} . $ The difference in volumes between the aluminum sample and brass weights can be found from the equation $ \\Delta V=\\frac{m}{\\rho_1}-\\frac{m}{\\rho_2}=m\\left(\\frac{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}\\right), $ where $m \\quad$ is the sought mass of the sample. From expressions $\\Delta V \\geq \\frac{m_0}{\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}}$ and $\\Delta V=\\frac{m}{\\rho_1}-\\frac{m}{\\rho_2}=m\\left(\\frac{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}\\right)$ we obtain $ m=\\Delta V\\left(\\frac{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}\\right) \\geq \\frac{m_0}{\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}\\right) . $  To find the mass $m$ of the sample one has to determine the difference $\\left(\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. With the general pressure being equal, in the second case, some part of dry air is replaced by vapor: $ \\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{\\Delta m_a}{V}-\\frac{\\Delta m_v}{V} . $  Changes of mass of air $\\Delta \\mathrm{m}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and vapor $\\Delta \\mathrm{m}_{\\mathrm{v}}$ can be found from the ideal-gas equation of state $ \\Delta m_a=\\frac{P_a V M_a}{R T}, \\quad \\Delta m_v=\\frac{P_v V M_v}{R T}, $ wherefrom we obtain $ \\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{P_a\\left(M_a-M_v\\right)}{R T} . $  From equations $m=\\Delta V\\left(\\frac{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}\\right) \\geq \\frac{m_0}{\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}\\right)$ and $\\rho_a^{\\prime}-\\rho_a^{\\prime \\prime}=\\frac{P_a\\left(M_a-M_v\\right)}{R T}$ we obtain $ m \\geq \\frac{m_0 R T}{P_a\\left(M_a-M_v\\right)}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}\\right) . $  The substitution of numerical values gives the answer: $m \\geq 0.0432 \\mathrm{~kg} \\approx 43 \\mathrm{~g}$. Note. When we wrote down expression $\\Delta V=\\frac{m}{\\rho_1}-\\frac{m}{\\rho_2}=m\\left(\\frac{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}\\right)$, we considered the sample mass be equal to the weights' mass, at the same time allowing for a small error.  One may choose another way of solving this problem. Let us calculate the change of Archimede's force by the change of the air average molar mass.  In dry air the condition of the balance between the sample and weights could be written down in the form of $ \\left(\\rho_1-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_1=\\left(\\rho_2-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_2 . $  In humid air its molar mass is equal to $ M=M_a \\frac{P_a}{P}+M_v \\frac{P-P_a}{P}, $ whereas the condition of finding the scale error could be written in the form $ \\left(\\rho_1-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_1-\\left(\\rho_2-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_2 \\geq m_0 . $ From expressions $\\left(\\rho_1-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_1=\\left(\\rho_2-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_2$,$M=M_a \\frac{P_a}{P}+M_v \\frac{P-P_a}{P}$ and $\\left(\\rho_1-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_1-\\left(\\rho_2-\\frac{M_a P}{R T}\\right) V_2 \\geq m_0$ one can get a more precise answer $ m \\geq \\frac{m_0 R T \\rho_1 \\rho_2-M_a P_a}{\\left(M_a-M_v\\right)\\left(\\rho_2-\\rho_1\\right) P_a} . $  Since $M_a P_a<<m_0 \\rho_1 \\rho_2 R T$, then both expressions $m \\geq \\frac{m_0 R T}{P_a\\left(M_a-M_v\\right)}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_1 \\rho_2}{\\rho_2-\\rho_1}\\right)$ and $m \\geq \\frac{m_0 R T \\rho_1 \\rho_2-M_a P_a}{\\left(M_a-M_v\\right)\\left(\\rho_2-\\rho_1\\right) P_a}$ lead practically to the same quantitative result, i.e. $\\mathrm{m} \\geq 43 \\mathrm{~g}$.",

In such a collision with a fix wall the speed $\\vec{v}$ of the particle changes only the direction so that the speed $\\vec{v}$ and the speed $\\vec{v}$ ' after collision there are in the same plane with the normal and the incident and reflection angle are equal. $ v_n^{\\prime}=-v_n, v_t^{\\prime}=v_t $  In the problem the wall moves with the speed $\\vec{u}$ perpendicular on the wall. The relative speed of the particle with respect the wall is $\\vec{v}-\\vec{u}$. Choosing the $\\mathrm{Oz}$ axis perpendicular on the wall in the sense of $\\vec{u}$, the conditions of the elastic collision give: $ \\begin{gathered} (\\vec{v}-\\vec{u})_z=-\\left(\\vec{v}^{\\prime}-\\vec{u}\\right)_z,(\\vec{v}-\\vec{u})_{x, y}=\\left(\\vec{v}^{\\prime}-\\vec{u}\\right)_{x, y} ; \\\\ v_z-u=-\\left(v_z^{\\prime}-u\\right), v_z^{\\prime}=2 u-v_z, v_{x, y}^{\\prime}=v_{x, y} \\end{gathered} $  The increase of the kinetic energy of the particle with mass $m_o$ after collision is: $ \\frac{1}{2} m_o v^{\\prime 2}-\\frac{1}{2} m_o v^2=\\frac{1}{2} m_o\\left(v_z^{\\prime 2}-v_z^2\\right)=2 m_o u\\left(u-v_z\\right) \\cong-2 m_o u v_z $ because $\\mathrm{u}$ is much smaller than $v_z$.

The axes of $S$ are parallel to those of $S^{\\prime}$ and the origins of both systems coincide at $t=0$. 1.

S^{\\prime \\prime}$ has a velocity $u$ with respect to $S^{\\prime}$.  According to the Lorentz contraction, the distance $a$, between adjacent balls of $A B$, measured in $S^{\\prime \\prime}$, is: $ a_r=\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{u^2}{c^2}}} $ (This result is valid for the distance between two adjacent balls that are in one of any sides, if $a$, is measured in the frame of reference in which they are at rest).

It is called \"laser cooling\" and is illustrated by the problem below.  In a vacuum chamber a well collimated beam of $\\mathrm{Na}^{23}$ atoms (coming from the evaporation of a sample at $10^3 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) is illuminated head-on with a high intensity laser beam (fig. 3.1). The frequency of laser is chosen so there will be resonant absorption of a photon by those atoms whose velocity is $v_0$. When the light is absorbed, these atoms are exited to the first energy level, which has a mean value $E$ above the ground state and uncertainty of $\\Gamma$ (fig. 3.2). For this process, the atom's decrease in velocity $\\Delta v_l$ is given by $\\Delta v_1=v_1-v_0$. Light is then emitted by the atom as it returns to its ground state. The atom's velocity changes by $\\Delta v^{\\prime}=v_1^{\\prime}-v_1$ and its direction of motion changes by an angle $\\varphi$ (fig. 3.3). This sequence of absorption and emission takes place many times until the velocity of the atoms has decreased by a given amount $\\Delta v$ such that resonant absorption of light at frequency $v$ no longer occurs. It is then necessary to change the frequency of laser so as to maintain resonant absorption. The atoms moving at the new velocity are further slowed down until some of them have a velocity close to zero.  As first approximation we may ignore any atomic interaction processes apart from the spontaneous absorption and emission light described above. Furthermore, we may assume the laser to be so intense that the atoms spend practically no time in the ground state.

With a string of negligible mass and length $L(L>2 \\pi R)$, a pendulum bob of mass $m$ is suspended from point $A$ at the top of the rod as shown in Figure 1a. The bob is raised until it is level with $A$ and then released from rest when the string is taut. Neglect any stretching of the string. Assume the pendulum bob may be treated as a mass point and swings only in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the rod. Accordingly, the pendulum bob is also referred to as the particle. The acceleration of gravity is $\\vec{g}$. Let $O$ be the origin of the coordinate system. When the particle is at point $P$, the string is tangential to the cylindrical surface at $Q$. The length of the line segment $Q P$ is called $s$. The unit tangent vector and the unit radial vector at $Q$ are given by $\\hat{t}$ and $\\hat{r}$, respectively. The angular displacement $\\theta$ of the radius $O Q$, as measured counterclockwise from the vertical $x$-axis along $O A$, is taken to be positive.  When $\\theta=0$, the length $s$ is equal to $L$ and the gravitational potential energy $U$ of the particle is zero. As the particle moves, the instantaneous time rates of change of $\\theta$ and $s$ are given by $\\dot{\\theta}$ and $\\dot{s}$, respectively.

A piston then steadily exerts a small pressure $p$ on its left face at $x=0$ for a very short time $\\Delta t$, causing a pressure wave to propagate with speed $u$ to the right. If the piston causes the rod's left face to move at a constant velocity $v$ (Figure $2 b$ ), what are the strain $S$ and pressure $p$ at the left face during the time $\\Delta t$ ? Answers must be given in terms of $\\rho, u$, and $v$ only.",

Compression or dilatation of the crystal generates an electric voltage across the crystal, and conversely, an external voltage applied across the crystal causes the crystal to expand or contract depending on the polarity of the voltage.

Denote the slab's strain and stress in the $x$ direction by $S$ and $T$, respectively.

In a static magnetic field the kinetic energy is conserved, thus $ \\mathrm{E}=\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{r}}^2+\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}^2+\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}^2\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{2} \\mathrm{v}_0^2 $  The radial points of inversion of the electron are defined by the condition $ \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathbf{r}}=0 $  Using eq. $\\mathrm{E}=\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{2}\\left(\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{r}}{ }^2+\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}{ }^2+\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}{ }^2\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{2} \\mathrm{v}_0{ }^2$ one obtains $ \\mathrm{v}_0^2=\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}{ }^2+\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}{ }^2 $  Such an inversion point is obviously given by $ \\mathrm{r}=\\mathrm{R} \\cdot\\left(\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}=\\mathrm{v}_0, \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{r}}=0, \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}=0\\right) . $  To find further inversion points and thus the maximum radial deviation of the electron the components of velocity $\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}$ and $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ in eq. $\\mathrm{v}_0{ }^2=\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}{ }^2+\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}{ }^2$ have to be expressed by the radius. $\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}$ will be determined by the law of conservation of angular momentum. The Lorentz force obviously has no component in the $\\varphi$ - direction (parallel to the magnetic field). Therefore it cannot produce a torque around the z-axis. From this follows that the $\\mathrm{z}$-component of the angular momentum is a constant, i.e. $\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{z}}=\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi} \\cdot \\mathrm{r}=\\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{v}_0 \\cdot \\mathrm{R}$ and therefore $\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}=\\mathrm{v}_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{R}}{\\mathrm{r}}$ $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ will be determined from the equation of motion in the $\\mathrm{z}$-direction. The $\\mathrm{z}$-component of the Lorentz force is $\\mathrm{F}_{\\mathrm{z}}=-\\mathrm{e} \\cdot \\mathrm{B} \\cdot \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{r}}$. Thus the acceleration in the $\\mathrm{z}$-direction is $ \\mathrm{a}_{\\mathrm{z}}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot \\mathrm{B} \\cdot \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{r}} . $  That means, since B is assumed to be constant, a change of $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ is related to a change of $\\mathrm{r}$ as follows: $ \\Delta \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot \\mathrm{B} \\cdot \\Delta \\mathrm{r} $  Because of $\\Delta \\mathrm{r}=\\mathrm{r}-\\mathrm{R}$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}=\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}$ one finds $ \\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot \\mathrm{B} \\cdot(\\mathrm{r}-\\mathrm{R}) $  Using eq. $\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}=\\mathrm{v}_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{R}}{\\mathrm{r}}$ and eq. $a_z=-\\frac{e}{m} \\cdot B \\cdot v_r$ one obtains for eq. $\\mathrm{v}_0{ }^2=\\mathrm{v}_{\\varphi}{ }^2+\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}{ }^2$ $ 1=\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{R}}{\\mathrm{r}}\\right)^2+\\mathrm{A}^2 \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{r}}{\\mathrm{R}}-1\\right)^2 $ where $\\mathrm{A}=\\frac{\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot \\mathrm{B} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{R}}{\\mathrm{v}_0}$ Discussion of the curve of the right side of eq. $1=\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{R}}{\\mathrm{r}}\\right)^2+\\mathrm{A}^2 \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{r}}{\\mathrm{R}}-1\\right)^2$ gives the qualitative result shown in the following diagram: ###img_2###  Hence $r_1$ is finite. Since $R \\leq r \\leq r_1$ eq. $\\mathrm{v}_{\\mathrm{z}}=-\\frac{\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{m}} \\cdot \\mathrm{B} \\cdot(\\mathrm{r}-\\mathrm{R})$ yields $v_z<0$. Hence the drift is in the direction of the negative $\\mathrm{z}$-axis.",

For Information Only For minimum $\\theta, \\frac{d \\theta}{d i}=0 . \\Rightarrow 1-\\frac{\\left(\\frac{v_{C P}}{v_P}\\right) \\cos i}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{v_{C P}}{v_P} \\sin i\\right)^2}}-\\frac{\\left(\\frac{R_C}{R}\\right) \\cos i}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\frac{R_C}{R} \\sin i\\right)^2}}=0$ Substituting $i=55.0^{\\circ}$ gives LHS $=0$, this verifying the minimum occurs at this value of $i$. Substituting $i=55.0^{\\circ}$ into (4) gives $\\theta=75.8^{\\circ}$.",

The current generated by the prey flows between two spheres with positive and negative potential in the prey's body. The distance between the centers of the two spheres is $l_s$, each having a radius of $r_s$, which is much smaller than $l_s$. The seawater resistivity is $\\rho$. Assume that the resistivity of the prey's body is the same as that of the surrounding seawater, implying that the boundary surrounding the prey in the figure can be ignored. In order to describe the detection of electric power by the predator coming from the prey, the detector is modeled similarly by two spheres on the predator's body and in contact with the surrounding seawater, lying parallel to the pair in the prey's body. They are separated by a distance of $l_d$, each having a radius of $r_d$ which is much smaller than $l_d$. In this case, the center of the detector is located at a distance $y$ right above the source and the line connecting the two spheres is parallel to the electric field as shown in Figure II-1. Both $l_s$ and $l_d$ are also much smaller than $y$. The electric field strength along the line connecting the two spheres is assumed to be constant. Therefore the detector forms a closed circuit system connecting the prey, the surrounding seawater and the predator as described in Figure II-2. In the figure, $V$ is the voltage difference between the detector's spheres due to the electric field induced by the prey, $R_m$ is the inner resistance due to the surrounding sea water. Further, $V_d$ and $R_d$ are respectively the voltage difference between the detecting spheres and the resistance of the detecting element within the predator. Determine the current density vector $\\vec{j}$ (current per unit area) caused by a point current source $I_s$ at a distance $r$ in an infinite medium.",

The area is normally a wide plateau but this time they find a deep crater-like depression, formed like a top-down cone with a depth $h$ of $100 \\mathrm{~m}$ and a radius $r$ of $500 \\mathrm{~m}$ (Figure 2.4). The thickness of the ice in the area is $2000 \\mathrm{~m}$. After a discussion the scientists conclude that most probably there was a minor volcanic eruption below the ice cap. A small amount of magma (molten rock) intruded at the bottom of the ice cap, solidified and cooled, melting a certain volume of ice. The scientists try as follows to estimate the volume of the intrusion and get an idea of what became of the melt water. Assume that the ice only moved vertically. Also assume that the magma was completely molten and at $1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ at the start. For simplicity, assume further that the intrusion had the form of a cone with a circular base vertically below the conical depression in the surface. The time for the rising of the magma was short relative to the time for the exchange of heat in the process. The heat flow is assumed to have been primarily vertical such that the volume melted from the ice at any time is bounded by a conical surface centered above the center of the magma intrusion. Given these assumptions the melting of the ice takes place in two steps. At first the water is not in pressure equilibrium at the surface of the magma and hence flows away. The water flowing away can be assumed to have a temperature of $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Subsequently,hydrostatic equilibrium is reached and the water accumulates above the intrusion instead of flowing away. When thermal equilibrium has been reached, you are asked to determine the following quantities. Write the answers on the answer sheet. 1. The height $H$ of the top of the water cone formed under the ice cap, relative to the original bottom of the ice cap. 2. The height $h_1$ of the intrusion. 3.

        "solution": "The volume of a circular cone is $V=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$. We assume that the height of the intrusion is $h_1$. We may say that it firstly melts an ice cone of its own volume $V_1=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h_1$. Pressure equilibrium has not yet been reached. Hence the water will flow away and the ice will keep contact with the face of the intrusion making the upper surface of the ice horizontal again. The intrusion then melts a volume equivalent to a cone of height $h_2=\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_i} h_1$ whereupon pressure equilibrium has been reached (following part (c)). During this second phase the melted water will also flow away. Assuming that the intrusion still has not cooled down to $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ the intrusion will further melt a volume equivalent to a cone of height $h_3$, its water accumulating in place, forming a cone of height $h_3^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\rho_i}{\\rho_w} h_3$ relative to the top of the intrusion. The total height of the ice cone melted is$h_{t o t}=h_1+h_2+h_3$. The depth of the depression at the surface will be given by $h=\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_i}\\left(h_1+h_3^{\\prime}\\right)$, which is most easily seen by considering pressure equilibrium in the final situation (again following part (c)). Thus, the requested height of the top of the water cone is $\\boldsymbol{H}=h_1+h_3^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\rho_i}{\\Delta \\rho} h=\\mathbf{1 . 1} \\times \\mathbf{1 0}^{\\mathbf{3}} \\mathbf{m}$.The heat balance gives $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2\\left\\{\\rho_r h_1\\left(L_r+c_r \\Delta T\\right)-\\rho_i L_i h_{t o t}\\right\\}=0$, where $\\Delta T=1200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ is the change in temperature of the rock intrusion. Following equation (2.17) and using the facts that $h_2=\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_i} h_1$ and $h_3=\\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_i} h_3^{\\prime}$ we obtain $h_{t o t}=h_1+\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_i} h_1+\\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_i} h_3^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\rho_w}{\\rho_i}\\left(h_1+h_3^{\\prime}\\right)$.

This implies that the cone does not reach the surface of the ice cap. Inserting the result into the equation (2.20) we can solve for $h_1$:$\\begin{aligned} \\rho_r h_1 & \\left(L_r+c_r \\Delta T\\right)=\\frac{\\rho_i \\rho_w L_i h}{\\Delta \\rho} \\ \\boldsymbol{h}_{\\mathbf{1}} & =\\frac{\\rho_i \\rho_w L_i h}{\\Delta \\rho \\rho_r\\left(L_r+c_r \\Delta T\\right)} \\ & =\\mathbf{1 0 3} \\mathbf{~ m}\\end{aligned}$.The total mass of water formed is of course equal to the mass of the ice melted and is$\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{t o t}}=\\rho_i(1 / 3) \\pi r^2 h_{t o t}=\\mathbf{2 . 9} \\cdot \\mathbf{1 0}^{\\mathbf{1 1}} \\mathbf{~ k g}$.The mass of the water which flows away is $\\boldsymbol{m}^{\\prime}=\\frac{h_1+h_2}{h_{t o t}} m_{t o t}=\\frac{\\rho_w h_1}{\\rho_i h_{t o t}} m_{t o t}=\\mathbf{2 . 7} \\cdot \\mathbf{1 0}^{\\mathbf{1 0}} \\mathbf{~ k g}$.",

A neuron in a human brain has the following property: when excited by an external signal, it makes one single oscillation and then returns to its initial state. This feature is called excitability. Due to this property, pulses can propagate in the network of coupled neurons constituting the nerve systems. A semiconductor chip designed to mimic excitability and pulse propagation is called a neuristor (from neuron and transistor). We attempt to model a simple neuristor using a circuit that includes the non-linear element $X$ that we investigated previously. To this end, the voltage$\\mathcal{E}$ in the circuit of Fig. 3 is decreased to the value $\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime}=$,$12.0 \\mathrm{~V}$. The oscillations stop, and the system reaches its stationary state. Then, the voltage is rapidly increased back to the value $\\mathcal{E}=15.0 \\mathrm{~V}$, and after a period of time $\\tau$ (with $\\tau<T$ ) is set again to the value $\\mathcal{E}^{\\prime}$ (see Fig. 4). It turns out that there is a certain critical value $\\tau_{\\text {crit. }}$, and the system shows qualitatively different behavior for $\\tau<\\tau_{\\text {crit }}$ and for $\\tau>\\tau_{\\text {crit }}$.Sketch the graphs of the time dependence of the current $I_X(t)$ on the non-linear element $X$ for $\\tau<\\tau_{\\text {crit }}$ and for $\\tau>\\tau_{\\text {crit }}$.",

In the first stage, a mass of magma ( $\\left.m_m\\right)$ at an absolute temperature $\\left(T_m\\right)$ mixes with a mass of external water $\\left(m_w\\right)$ at an absolute temperature $\\left(T_w\\right)$. The thermal equilibrium is reached almost instantaneously. This interaction can be perceived as a nearly-constant volume process. Latent heat of evaporation of water and latent heat of melting of magma can be neglected.Find the equilibrium temperature at the first stage in terms of the masses and heat capacity per unit mass of water $c_{V w}$ and magma $c_{V m}$.",

The earthquake was caused by a sudden displacement of the Opak fault segment (see Fig. 2). The hypocenter was located $15 \\mathrm{~km}$ below the surface. The seismic wave that propagates on the earth crust can be recorded using seismometer. The diagram from seismometer is called seismogram (Fig. 2 and 3, Lower graph). The seismograms represent the vertical ground velocity as a function of time recorded by the seismic station at Gamping Station Yogyakarta (YOGI) (Fig. 2) and Denpasar, Bali (DNP) (Fig. 3). In general, seismic wave consists of three wave types: the longitudinal or primary ( $P$-wave), the transversal or secondary ( $S$-wave), and the surface wave. The $P$-wave and $S$-wave travel in the subsurface while the surface wave travels along the Earth surface. Seismic waves traveling through subsurfaces to the stations can be divided into those that propagate in a straight line, those that are reflected by a layer's boundary, and those that are refracted into the next layer. The longitudinal wave or the primary wave has the highest velocity, while the surface wave has the lowest velocity, around $60 \\%$ of the $P$-wave.The distance between the epicenter (the projection of hypocenter on the Earth surface) and the YOGI and DNP stations respectively are $22.5 \\mathrm{~km}$ and $500 \\mathrm{~km}$. The depth of the Earth crust layer in Java, Indonesia, is $30 \\mathrm{~km}$. Beneath the Earth's crust is the Earth's mantle layer. Just like other wave phenomena, seismic wave also satisfies the Snell's law. The seismic wave can also be reflected by the mantle layer. In this problem we assume that the earth curvature is neglected.Fig. 2 shows the seismogram at the YOGI station. Use the data to find the velocity of the $P$-wave in the Earth crust.",

Zwicky used the Virial theorem to estimate the mass of the galaxy cluster. In a simple sun-planet system, where the planet revolves around the sun in a circular orbit, the Virial theorem states that the kinetic energy of the planet is exactly related to its gravitational potential energy. While in a general case for a system of many particles bounded by some interaction, the Virial theorem, relates the time average total kinetic energy with its time average total potential energy. In 1933, based on his observation on the velocity of the galaxies near the edge of the Coma galaxy cluster, Zwicky estimated that the cluster has more mass than what was visually observed (i.e. the galaxies). The gravitational attraction from the observable matter (the galaxies) was too small to account for the velocities of the galaxies. Thus there must be some hidden masses that account for such a large velocity. That hidden mass is the dark matter mass. In what follows, assume that the mass of each galaxy is the sum of its visible mass and the mass of the dark matter which moves together with that galaxy, and dark matter interacts with visible matter only gravitationally.Consider a cluster of galaxies consist of a large number $N$ of galaxies and dark matter that are distributed homogeneously in a sphere of radius $R$ with the total mass (galaxies and dark matters) of the cluster $M$.

This forms the basis of the power generating nuclear reactor (NR). A typical NR consists of a cylindrical tank of height $H$ and radius $R$ filled with a material called moderator. Cylindrical tubes, called fuel channels, each containing a cluster of cylindrical fuel pins of natural $\\mathrm{UO}_2$ in solid form of height $H$, are kept axially in a square array. Fission neutrons, coming outward from a fuel channel, collide with the moderator, losing energy, and reach the surrounding fuel channels with low enough energy to cause fission (Figs I-III). Heat generated from fission in the pin is transmitted to a coolant fluid flowing along its length. In the current problem we shall study some of the physics behind the (A) Fuel Pin, (B) Moderator and (C) NR of cylindrical geometry.Consider the following fission reaction of a stationary ${ }^{235} \\mathrm{U}$ after it absorbs a neutron of negligible kinetic energy. ${ }^{235} \\mathrm{U}+{ }^1 \\mathrm{n} \\longrightarrow{ }^{94} \\mathrm{Zr}+{ }^{140} \\mathrm{Ce}+2{ }^1 \\mathrm{n}+\\Delta E$.Estimate $\\Delta E$ (in $\\mathrm{MeV})$ the total fission energy released.

        "problem": "The approximation of rigid cylindrical vessels falls short for several reasons. It is particularly important to include the time dependent flow and to take into account the change in vessel diameter that occurs when the pressure varies during a blood pumping cycle done by the heart. Moreover, it is observed that in the larger vessels the blood pressure varies significantly during a cycle, while in the smaller vessels the amplitude of the oscillations in pressure is much smaller, and the flow is almost time independent. When the pressure increases in a single elastic vessel, there will be an increase in its diameter, thus permitting to store more fluid in the vessel, and to deliver it when the pressure drops. For this reason, the elastic behaviour of the vessel can be simulated by adding a capacitor to our initial description. Moreover, when taking into account the time dependent blood flow rate, one has to consider the inertia of the fluid, proportional to its density $\\rho=1.05 \\times 10^3 \\mathrm{~kg} \\mathrm{~m}^{-3}$. This inertia can be described by an inductance in our model. In Figure 2 we represent the equivalent circuit for a single vessel in this model. The equivalent capacitance and inductance are given by$C=\\frac{3 \\ell \\pi r^3}{2 E h} \\quad$ and $\\quad L=\\frac{9 \\ell \\rho}{4 \\pi r^2}$,respectively, where $h$ is the width of the vessel wall and $E$ is the artery Young's modulus, a coefficient that describes the alteration in size of the vessel tissue when a force is applied. The Young's modulus has units of pressure and is on the order of $E=0.06 \\mathrm{MPa}$ for arterioles.Obtain, in the stationary regime, the pressure amplitude at the vessel outlet, $P_{\text {out }}$, as a function of the pressure amplitude at the inlet, $P_{\text {in }}$, the equivalent resistance, $R$, inductance, $L$ and capacitance, $C$, for a flow with angular frequency $\\omega$.

In this problem we will consider a simplified model of tumour growth that addresses the increase in pressure commonly observed in solid tumors. Consider a group of normal cells forming a tissue surrounded by an inextensible basement membrane, which forces the tissue to maintain always the same form: a sphere of radius $R$ (Figure 3).Initially the tissue does not have residual stresses, i.e. the pressure at every point is equal to the atmospheric pressure. At time $t=0$, a tumour starts growing at the centre of this sphere and, as it grows, the pressure inside the tissue increases. Consider that both tissues (normal, $N$, and tumour, $T$ ) are compressible such that their densities, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{N}}$ and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{T}}$, increase linearly with pressure:$\\rho_{\\mathrm{N}}=\\rho_0\\left(1+\\frac{p}{K_{\\mathrm{N}}}\\right), \\quad \\rho_{\\mathrm{T}}=\\rho_0\\left(1+\\frac{p}{K_{\\mathrm{T}}}\\right)$,where $\rho_0$ is the rest tissue density, $p$ is the pressure difference to the atmospheric pressure and $K_{\\mathrm{N}}, K_{\\mathrm{T}}$ are the compressibility moduli (bulk moduli) of the normal and tumour tissues, respectively.

The top quark decays into a $W^{+}$ boson and a bottom quark (b), while the anti-top quark decays into a $W^{-}$boson and an anti-bottom quark $(\\bar{b})$. In the case depicted in Figure 1, the $W^{+}$boson decays into a anti-muon $\\left(\\mu^{+}\\right)$and a neutrino $(\\nu)$, and the $W^{-}$boson decays into a quark and an anti-quark. The task of this problem is to reconstruct the full momentum of the neutrino using the momenta of some detected particles. For simplicity, all particles and jets in this problem will be considered massless, except for the top quark and $\\mathbf{W}^{ \\pm}$bosons. The momenta of the top quark decay products can be determined from the experiment (see Table), except for the neutrino momentum component along the ( $z$-axis). The total linear momentum of the final state particles caught by the detector is only zero on the transverse plane ( $x y$ plane), and not along the collision line ( $z$-axis). As such, one can find the transverse momentum of the neutrino from the missing momentum in the transverse plane. On June 4,2015 , the ATLAS experiment at the LHC recorded a proton-proton collision at 00:21:24 GMT+1 like the one represented in Figure 1.The linear momenta of the three final-state particles coming from the top quark decay, including the neutrino, is presented below for each component.Find an equation which relates the square of the $W^{+}$boson mass, $m_{\\mathrm{W}^2}^2$, with the neutrino and anti-muon momentum components presented in the table above.

The protons are not spread uniformly around the circumference of the accelerator, but they are clustered in so-called bunches.

Let us now slowly incline the base by an angle $\\Theta$ (see Fig. 2). As a result of the static friction, the wooden cylinder can roll freely without sliding. It will roll down the incline a little bit, but then come to rest in a stable equilibrium after rotating by an angle $\\phi$ which we measure.Find an expression for $b$ as a function of the quantities (1), the angle $\\phi$ and the tilting angle $\\Theta$ of the base.",

Equation for Coriolis force with correct velocity: $F_C(t)=2 m \\omega_{s s}^2 R t \\omega_{s s}=2 m \\omega_{s s}^3 R t$. Integrate this, or realize that it is like uniform acceleration for the velocity: $v_x(t)=\\omega_{s s}^3 R t^2$. Plug in correct value for $t=\\sqrt{2 H / \\omega_{s s}^2 R}$. Overall correct result $v_x=2 H \\omega_{s s}$. - The displacement $d_x$: Integrate $v_x(t)$: $d_x=\\frac{1}{3} R \\omega_{s s}^3 t^3$. Instead of integrating, students may simply 'average' by taking $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the final velocity. This gives a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ instead of $\\frac{1}{3}$. Deduct a total of 0.1 pts for this. Plug in value for $t$, $d_x=\\frac{1}{3} R \\omega_{s s}^3\\left(2 H / \\omega_{s s}^2 R\\right)^{3 / 2}=\\frac{1}{3} 2^{3 / 2} H^{3 / 2} R^{-1 / 2}=\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 H^3}{R}}$. Solution two: - Using inertial frame This solution is similar to the way to solve B7, but needs more complicated approximations than Solution one. - $v_x$.Here $\\phi$ denotes the angle swept by the mass and $\\alpha$ the angle the astronauts (and tower) has rotated when the mass lands on the floor, see. Initially the velocity of the mass in an inertial frame is $v_x=\\omega_{s s}(R-H)$. When the mass lands, the $x$-direction has been rotated by $\\phi$ so the new horizontal velocity component is then $\\omega_{s s}(R-H) \\cos \\phi$. (Student may also write $\\cos \\alpha$ instead of $\\cos \\phi$, since $d_x \\ll H$.)$\\cos \\phi=\\frac{R-H}{R}=1-\\frac{H}{R}$. Transforming to the rotating reference frame, one needs to subtract $\\omega_{s s} R$. Finally in the reference frame of the astronauts $v_x=\\omega_{s s} R\\left(1-\\frac{H}{R}\\right)^2-\\omega_{s s} R \\approx \\omega_{s s} R\\left(1-2 \\frac{H}{R}\\right)-\\omega_{s s} R=-2 \\omega_{s s} H$. The sign of the velocity depend on the choice of reference direction, so a positive sign is also correct.- $d_x$.With the notation from the calculation of $v_x$, $d_x=(\\alpha-\\phi) R$, $\\begin{gathered} \\phi=\\arccos \\left(1-\\frac{H}{R}\\right) \\ \\alpha=\\omega_{s s} t \\end{gathered}$, where $t$ is the fall time of the mass, which is given by $t=\\frac{\\sqrt{R^2-(R-H)^2}}{\\omega_{s s}(R-H)}$, (see solution to B7). Writing $\\xi \\equiv H / R$ this means $d_x=\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{1-(1-\\xi)^2}}{1-\\xi}-\\arccos (1-\\xi)\\right] R$, which is a valid end answer to the problem. It is possible, but not necessary, to approximate this for small $\\xi$: $\\arccos (1-\\xi) \\approx \\sqrt{2 \\xi}\\left(1+\\frac{\\xi}{12}\\right)$, which after insertion into the equation for $d_x$ and approximation of small $\\xi$ yields the same result as in Solution one: $d_x=\\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 H^3}{R}}$. If this end answer misses the factor $2 / 3$, deduct 0.1 points. Solution three: - Inertial frame with geometry trick. This is an alternative solution to obtain $d_x$. The mass travels the distance $l$, and during the fall the space station rotates by $\\phi$, see. Figure 2. According to the intersecting chord theorem, $l^2=H(2 R-H)$. The rotated angle is $\\phi=\\omega_{s s} t$ where $t=\\frac{l}{R-H}$ is the fall time. Thus $\\begin{aligned} & \\qquad \\phi=\\frac{\\sqrt{H(2 R-H)}}{R-H} \\ & \\frac{d}{R}=\\phi-\\arcsin \\frac{l}{R}=\\frac{\\sqrt{H(2 R-H)}}{R-H}-\\arcsin \\sqrt{x(2-x)} \\end{aligned}$.",

        "solution": "a)Solution Method 1, At the impact the prism starts rotating about a new axis, i.e. the edge which just hit the plane. The force from the plane has no torque about this axis, so that the angular momentum about the edge is conserved during the brief interval of impact. The linear momentum of the prism as a whole has the same direction as the velocity of the center of mass ( $\\vec{P}=M \\vec{v}_C$ where the subscript $C$ refers to the center of mass), and this direction is easy to follow when we know the axis of rotation at a given time. Just before impact $\\vec{P}$ is directed $30^{\\circ}$ downwards relative to the plane, but will after impact point $30^{\\circ}$ upwards from the plane, see Figure 1.3.To find the angular momentum about the edge of impact just before the impact we use the equation relating angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ about an arbitrary axis to the angular momentum $\\vec{L}_C$ about an axis through the center of mass parallel to the first one:$\\vec{L}=\\vec{L}_C+M \\vec{r}_C \\times \\vec{v}_C$,where the subscript $C$ refers to the center of mass. Here, this is applied to an axis at the point of impact so that $\\vec{r}_C$ is the vector from that point to the center of mass (Figure 1.3). The vectors on the right hand side of equation (1.7) both have the same direction. Hence we get for the quantities just before impact ${ }^2$.$\\begin{aligned}\\left|\\vec{r}_C \\times \\vec{v}_{C i}\\right| & =r_C v_{C i} \\sin 30^{\\circ}=a^2 \\omega_i / 2 \\ L_i=I \\omega_i+\\frac{1}{2} M a^2 \\omega_i & =\\left(\\frac{5}{12}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) M a^2 \\omega_i=\\frac{11}{12} M a^2 \\omega_i\\end{aligned}$. On the other hand, angular momentum about the edge just after impact is, from equation (1.2): ${ }^3$,$L_f=I^{\\prime} \\omega_f=\\frac{17}{12} M a^2 \\omega_f$, where the subscript $f$ always refers to the situation just after impact. We may notice that the difference comes about because of the different directions of $\\vec{v}_{C i}$ and $\\vec{v}_{C f}$. Now, when we state the conservation of angular momentum, $L_i=L_f$, we obtain a relation between the angular velocities as follows:$\\omega_f=\\frac{11 / 12}{17 / 12} \\omega_i=\\frac{11}{17} \\omega_i$.We thus get: $s=11 / 17$. We may note that $s$ is independent of $a, \\omega_i$, and $\\theta$.Solution Method 2:On impact the prism receives an impulse $\\vec{P}[\\mathrm{~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}]$ from the plane at the edge where the impact occurs. There is no reaction at the edge which is leaving the plane. The impulse has a component $P_{\\|}$parallel to the inclined plane (positive upwards along the incline in Figure 1.3 and a component $P_{\\perp}$ perpendicular to the plane (positive upwards from the plane in the same figure). We can set up three equations with the three unknowns $P_{\\|}, P_{\\perp}$ and the ratio $s=\\frac{\\omega_f}{\\omega_i}$. The quantity $P_{\\|}$is the change in the parallel component of the linear momentum of the prism and $P_{\\perp}$ is the corresponding change in perpendicular linear momentum. Thus:$\\begin{aligned} & P_{\\|}=M\\left(\\omega_i-\\omega_f\\right) a \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ & P_{\\perp}=M\\left(\\omega_i+\\omega_f\\right) a \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} .\\end{aligned}$We finally have: $P_{\\perp} a \\frac{1}{2}-P_{\\|} a \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}=I\\left(\\omega_i-\\omega_f\\right)$, since the right hand side is the change in angular momentum about the center of mass. Equations (1.13), (1.14) and (1.15) can now be solved for the ratio $s=\\frac{\\omega_f}{\\omega_i}$ giving, of course, the same result as before. $\\begin{aligned} L_f & =I \\omega_f+M\\left|\\vec{r}_C \\times \\vec{v}_{C f}\\right|=I \\omega_f+M a^2 \\omega_f \\sin 90^{\\circ} \\ & =\\left(\\frac{5}{12}+1\\right) M a^2 \\omega_f=\\frac{17}{12} M a^2 \\omega_f \\end{aligned}$.",

Between subsequent impacts the height of the center of mass of the prism decreases by $a \\sin \\theta$ and its kinetic energy increases for this reason by $\\Delta=M g a \\sin \\theta$. We therefore have $K_{i, n+1}=r K_{i, n}+\\Delta$. One does not have to write out the complete expression $K_{i, n}$ as a function of $K_{i, 1}$ and $n$ to find the limit. This would actually be a proof that the limit exists (see below) but this is given in the problem text. Hence one can make $K_{i, n+1} \\approx K_{i, n}$ arbitrarily accurate for sufficiently large $n$. The limit $K_{i, 0}$ must thus satisfy the iterative formula, i.e. $K_{i, 0}=r K_{i, 0}+\\Delta$,yielding the solution $K_{i, 0}=\\frac{\\Delta}{1-r}$, i.e. $\\kappa=\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{1-r}$.We can also solve the problem explicitly by writing out the full expressions: $\\begin{aligned} K_{i, 2} & =r K_{i, 1}+\\Delta \\ K_{i, 3} & =r K_{i, 2}+\\Delta=r^2 K_{i, 1}+(1+r) \\Delta \\ \\ldots & \\ K_{i, n} & =r^{n-1} K_{i, 1}+\\left(1+r+\\ldots+r^{n-2}\\right) \\Delta \\ & =r^{n-1} K_{i, 1}+\\frac{1-r^{n-1}}{1-r} \\Delta \\end{aligned}$. In the limit of $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ we get $K_{i, n} \\rightarrow K_{i, 0}=\\frac{\\Delta}{1-r}$ which is, of course, the same result as before. If we calculate the change in kinetic energy through a whole cycle, i.e. from just before impact number $n$ until just before impact $n+1$ we get,$\\begin{aligned} \\Delta K_{i, n}=K_{i, n+1}-K_{i, n} & =(r-1) r^{n-1} K_{i, 1}+r^{n-1} \\Delta \\ & =r^{n-1}\\left(\\Delta-(1-r) K_{i, 1}\\right)\\end{aligned}$.This is positive if the initial value $K_{i, 1}<K_{i, 0}$ so that $K_{i, n}$ will then increase up to the limit value $K_{i, 0}$. If, on the other hand, $K_{i, 1}>K_{i, 0}$, the kinetic energy $K_{i, n}$ just before impact will decrease down to the limit $K_{i, 0}$. All of this may remind you of motion with friction which increases with speed. Mathematically speaking, the main difference is that we here are dealing with difference equations instead of differential equations.",

For $\\dot{q}>0$, the equilibrium point is $q_{2}=0$ or $q=-C V_{d}$, while for $\\dot{q}<0$ it is $q=C V_{d}$. So the orbit will consist of half-ellipses in the upper and the lower parts of the $I-q$ diagram, centred at $q=-C V_{d}$ for the upper half and at $q=C V_{d}$ for the lower half. As the evolution is continuous, these half-ellipses will join up at $I=0$.",

        "solution": "Consider the pressure difference at heights $z+d z$ and $z: d p=$ $-\\rho g d z$ (the difference is simply due to the weight of the layer $d z)$. The density can be found using the state equation of ideal gas: $p V=\\frac{m}{\\mu} R T, \\quad \\rho=\\frac{m}{V}=\\frac{\\mu p}{R T}$. Therefore $\\frac{1}{p} \\frac{d p}{d z}=-\\frac{\\mu g}{R T}$. Note that we have a derivative of a logarithm: $\\frac{1}{p} \\frac{d p}{d z}=\\frac{d \\ln p(z)}{d z}$. Therefore $\\ln \\left(p / p_{0}\\right)=-\\alpha z, \\quad p=p_{0} e^{-\\alpha z}$, where $\\alpha=\\frac{\\mu g}{R T}$. Alternatively, we can derive this law from the Boltzmann distribution for the particle density $n=n_{0} e^{-U / k T}$, where $U$ is the potential energy of a molecule. Bearing in mind that for a constant temperature, the pressure is propotional to the density, we obtain $p=p_{0} e^{-U / k T}$. Substituting $U=m g z=\\frac{\\mu}{N_{A}} g z$ and $R=k N_{A}$, we obtain the same result as above.",

Hence, $F=k f(t)$, i.e. the fuel consumption graph can be interpreted as a force graph. The proportionality constant $k$ can be found from the fact that when the car is starting from the rest, there is no air drag (air drag is zero if speed is zero), and hence, all the driving force goes to accelerating the car, $F(0 s)=m a_{0}$ Keeping in mind that $f(0 \\mathrm{~s})=331 / 100 \\mathrm{~km}=$ $m a_{0} / k=\\frac{m g}{2 k}$, we obtain $\\frac{k}{m g}=1.52 \\mathrm{~km} / 1$ At $v_{0}=90 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{h}$, there is air drag which we need to consider, but since the speed is constant so is the force from the air drag and we can just subtract $F(16 s)$ to get the force without the air $\\mathrm{drag}$.

Since energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the electric field, if a fraction $r$ of the photons and therefore of the energy is reflected, the amplitude of the reflected wave's electric field is $\\sqrt{r}$ of the incident electric field. Let's calculate the total electric field amplitude of the wave that goes through. Denote by $E_{i}$ the electric field of the incident wave and by $E_{t}$ the electric field of the wave that has gone through the other side of the glass. On the incident side the proportion of the electric field amplitude that goes through is $\\sqrt{1-r}$, of which a part $\\sqrt{1-r}$ will go through and part $\\sqrt{r}$ will bounce pack. So a wave with amplitude $E_{0}=(1-r) E_{i}$ went straight through and a wave with amplitude $\\sqrt{(1-r) r} E_{i}$ is boun cing back through the glass. Now it will go back to the first side, reflect back from there and of that a proportion $\\sqrt{1-r}$ will go through and add to $E_{t}$. However the wave has traveled an optical path $2 n d=200.5 \\lambda$, so it will be 180 degrees out of phase and we get $E_{1}=-(1-r) r E_{i}$. Repeating the procedure $E_{2}=(1-r) r^{2} E_{i}$ and so on $E_{n}=(1-r)(-r)^{n} E_{i}$. Summing all the electric fields that go through the other side of the glass we get: $E_{t}=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} E_{n}=(1-r) E_{i} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(-r)^{n}=\\frac{1-r}{1+r} E_{i}$. Power is proportional to the square of the electric field: $\\frac{P_{t}}{P}=\\left(\\frac{E_{t}}{E_{i}}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\frac{1-r}{1+r}\\right)^{2}$. Since power is also proportional to the number of photons, this fraction of the photons have gone through and haven't given their momentum to the glass. By energy conservation the rest have been reflected back toward the laser and since their momentum has been reversed: $\\begin{aligned} F_{c} & =2\\left(\\frac{P-P_{t}}{c}\\right)=\\frac{2 P}{c}\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{1-r}{1+r}\\right)^{2}\\right) \\\\ & =\\frac{8 P r}{c(1+r)^{2}} .\\end{aligned}$ Note: if we would calculate directly the total electric field of the reflected light, we would need to take into account that on the first reflection of the laser light from the glass there is a phase shift of 180 degrees due to reflection from a surface with a higher refractive index (air to glass surface).",

Since $\\alpha T \\approx$ $2.4 \\times 10^{-4}$ is much smaller than the change in the speed of sound, we can ignore it. Using the given formula for the speed of sound, we have $f=f_{0} \\sqrt{1+\\frac{45}{273.15}} / \\sqrt{1+\\frac{25}{273.15}} \\approx 341 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. This is a significant change. For the guitar string the speed of the wave can depend on the mass $m$ of the string, the length $L$ and the tension $T$. Using dimensional analysis we get $v \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{L T}{m}}$. A more accurate derivation will show that the constant of proportionality is 1 which would be the simplest guess. The lowest frequency on the string has a wavelength of $2 L$, because the wave has to have nodes at the ends of the string. The tension is given by $T=E S \\Delta L / L$ where $\\Delta L$ is the change in length of the string due to the tension and $S$ is the area of the cross section of the string. Putting it all together:$f=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{L T}{m}}}{2 L}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{L E S \\Delta L / L}{\\rho S L}}}{2 L}=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{E \\Delta L / L}{\\rho}}}{2 L} .$ Let's find $\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}=\\frac{\\rho}{E}(2 L f)^{2} \\approx 7.3 \\times 10^{-3}$ When the temperature increases and the string stretches, the relative lengthening $\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}$ will de crease by $\\alpha T, \\frac{\\Delta L}{L} \\rightarrow \\frac{\\Delta L}{L}-\\alpha T=$ $\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha T}{\\Delta L / L}\\right)=\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\left(1-3.3 \\times 10^{-2}\\right)$. This proportional change is larger than the changes in the other factors (the lengths get scaled by $(1+\\alpha \\Delta T)$ ), which we can ignore. We get $f=$ $f_{0} \\sqrt{1-3.3 \\times 10^{-2}} \\approx 325 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. This is also a sig nificant change when the instruments are playing together.",

The angular momentum of the falling body is conserved, hence $\\omega^{\\prime} r^2=\\omega R^2$. We can substitute $r=R-y$, where $y$ is the current depth, and approximate $\\omega^{\\prime}=\\omega\\left(\\frac{R}{r}\\right)^2 \\approx \\omega\\left(1+2 \\frac{y}{R}\\right)$. Therefore, the horizontal displacement speed in the Earth's frame of reference $v_h=\\left(\\omega^{\\prime}-\\omega\\right) r \\approx 2 \\omega y R$. Finally, horizontal dipslacement is found as $\\Delta x=\\int v_h \\mathrm{~d} t=$ $\\int\\left(2 \\omega y R / v_v\\right) \\mathrm{d} y$, where the vertical falling speed $v_v=\\sqrt{2 g y}$. So, we find $\\Delta x=\\frac{2}{3} R \\omega \\sqrt{2 h^3 / g} \\approx$ $22 \\mathrm{~m}$. Now, let obtain the same result using the Kepler's laws. Consider the trajectory of the steel ball as seen in a non-rotating frame of reference. Although it is a thin ellipse, we have drawn the figure out of scale in order the facilitate the calculation of areas. The steel ball is released from point $A$ and it hits the bottom of the shaft at point $\\mathrm{D}$, at distance $x$ from $\\mathrm{B}$, the location of bottom at the start of fall. As the falling time is still $t=\\sqrt{2 h / g}$, the location of the bottom travels $x^{\\prime}=(v-\\Delta v) t=v t-\\omega h t$ during the fall. Thus, the horizontal displacement of the landing point is simply $\\Delta x=x-x^{\\prime}$. Now, the distance $x$ can be found using the Kepler's second law, stating that the area covered by radius vector per unit time $\\Delta S / \\Delta t$ is constant, which is a manifestation of conservation of angular momentum $\\Delta S / \\Delta t=L / 2 m=r v_{\\perp} / 2$. (The latter relation could easily be obtained by observing a circular orbit.) For our steel ball, $L / 2 m=R v / 2=\\omega R^{2} / 2$. The area covered by the steel ball can be calculated as the sum of the segment OBD and the region ADB. Keeping in mind that $x \\ll R$, the segment $\\mathrm{OBD}$ is simply a triangle with area $x(R-h) / 2$. Likewise, the region ACDB is approximately a rectangle of area $x h$ and knowing that a parabola divides the area of its surrounding rectangle into proportions $1 / 3$ and $2 / 3$, we conclude that the area of region $\\mathrm{ADB}$ is $2 x h / 3$. Thus, from the Kepler's second law:$ \\begin{array}{r} S=\\frac{1}{2} x(R-h)+\\frac{2}{3} x h=\\frac{1}{2} v R t, \\\\ x=\\frac{v t}{1+\\frac{1}{3} \\frac{h}{R}} \\approx v t-\\frac{1}{3} \\omega h t . \\end{array}$. Finally, the horizontal displacement $\\Delta x=$ $x-x^{\\prime}=\\frac{2}{3} \\omega h t \\approx 22 \\mathrm{~mm}$. (Note that the naive answer overestimated the correct one by $50 \\%$.)",

Finally, $F_{e}=k\\left(X_{0}-X_{1}\\right)=Q E / 2$ (this result could have been obtained from energetic considerations, using infinitesimal virtual displacement of the plate and the energy conservation law). So, $F_{e}=\\frac{S}{2} \\varepsilon_{0}\\left(U / X_{1}\\right)^{2}$, hence $U=X_{1} \\sqrt{2 k\\left(X_{0}-X_{1}\\right) / S \\varepsilon_{0}}$.",

Here, the second term describes the voltage change on the capacitor due to the change of the capacitance (we approximate the real change by differential, valid for small shifts $x$ ). Note that $C^{-1}=X_{1} / S \\varepsilon_{0}$ and $L \\ddot{q}=-\\frac{q}{C}-U \\frac{x}{X_{1}}$. Here, the sign of the second term assumes that the $x$-axes is directed upwards (there is no current in the inductance and $L \\ddot{q}=0$, if the voltage on the capacitor keeps constant; for increasing charge $q>0$, this assumes increasing capacitance, i.e. $x<0$; in a full agreement with the signs of the above expression). The second equation describes the Newton second law. First we note that the expression for $F_{e}$ can be rewritten as $F_{e}=Q^{2} / 2 S \\varepsilon_{0}$. So, if the charge on the plate does not change $(q=0)$, neither does change $F_{e}$. So, $\\delta F_{e}=q \\frac{d}{d Q} Q^{2} / 2 S \\varepsilon_{0}=q Q / S \\varepsilon_{0}$. The infinitesimal force changes $\\left(\\delta F_{k}\\right.$ and $\\left.\\delta F_{e}\\right)$ can be simply added: $m \\ddot{x}=-k x-q Q / S \\varepsilon_{0}$.

Because the distance between the two images of the dragons is relatively small compared to the height of the dragon, the height of the water level is almost $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$, i.e. the dragon's height. But by comparing the water level to the diameter of the bowl the water level is around $7 \\mathrm{~cm}$. So either the bowl's diameter or the dragon's height is incorrect. Neglecting the inconsistency of the provided values we will give the solution method below. The dragon is relatively large and covers most of the bottom of the bowl. Therefore when viewing from below we would expect some of the rays to always hit the dragon after being reflected from the horizontal top water surface. This happens until the rays are incident to the water surface at an angle smaller than the total internal reflection angle. Then the rays will go through the water surface and we no longer see the reflection of the dragon.

The last point that we will see as we increase the viewing angle is the image of the highest point of the dragon, which we denote by $\\boldsymbol{O}$. By using a ruler to measure the size of the dragon and the distance between the highest point of the dragon to the same point on the reflected image, we get $4.5 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and $0.45 \\mathrm{~cm}$. The actual height of the dragon is $3 \\mathrm{~cm}$, so the actual distance between the dragon and its reflection is $2 h=\\frac{0.45}{4.5} \\cdot 3 \\mathrm{~cm}=0.3 \\mathrm{~cm}$. The two images are at equal distances from the water surface, because they are reflections of each other. Therefore the distance from the highest point of the dragon to the water surface is $h=0.15 \\mathrm{~cm}$. The height $H$ of the water surface can be measured from the photo, by measuring the diameter of the bottom of the bowl and the height of the water level on the photo with a ruler.

Because $|Q B| \\gg|O B|$, we have approximately $\\angle Q O B=$ $\\angle Q B O=90^{\\circ}$ and all the points $B, C$ and $O$ are approximately on the same line. The radius vector of the comet covers an area $S_{B C P}$ contained between the segment $B C P$ of the ellipse and the straight line $B C$. We will approximate this segment of the ellipse as a parabola. The surface area of a mirror-symmetric parabolic segment is equal to two thirds of the product of its height and length, as can be determined by integrating the parabola: $S_{B C P}=\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2 R_0 \\cdot \\frac{R_0}{2}=\\frac{2}{3} R_0^2 . $ By Kepler's second law the comet sweeps out equal areas in equal times (i.e. the time required to cover some segment of the ellipse is proportional to the area of the segment drawn out by the radius vector connecting the comet and the Sun). Since $v_t=w$, the radius vector of the comet covers the surface area at the same rate as the radius vector of the Earth, which is $\\pi R_0^2 / T$, where $T$ is one year. Therefore $t=\\frac{S_{B C P}}{\\pi R_0^2} T=\\frac{2}{3 \\pi} 365 \\text { days } \\approx 77 \\text { days. }$",

Now let us consider the effect of masses. Let us define $a:=\\frac{\\left(m_1 m_2\\right)^2}{\\left(m_1+m_2\\right)^4}$. The intuition tells us, that more power should be radiated off a bigger system, thus the masses should tend to infinity for maximum power. However the limit $\\lim _{m_1=m_2 \\rightarrow \\infty} a=1$ suggests otherwise. So does the dimensional analysis: the dimension of $[a]=\\frac{(\\boldsymbol{M} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{M})^2}{M^4}=1$ means that the absolute values of the masses don't contribute to the equation. This is intuitively explained by the proportionally increasing Schwarzschild radii. However the mass distribution does matter, since $a$ isn't the same for all $m_1, m_2$ either. Let us determine the maximum value it can take. Let us redefine it in terms of the total mass $M:=m_1+m_2$ and the mass distribution $k:=\\frac{m_1}{M}$. Then $m_1=k M$, $m_2=(1-k) M$, $\\Rightarrow a=\\frac{\\left(m_1 m_2\\right)^2}{\\left(m_1+m_2\\right)^4}=\\frac{(k M(k-1) M)^2}{M^4}=[k(k-1)]^2$, $\\frac{d}{d k}[k(k-1)]^2=0 \\Leftrightarrow k=\\frac{1}{2} \\Leftrightarrow m_1=m_2$, $\\Rightarrow a_{\\text {max }}=\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right]^2=\\frac{1}{16}$.

Let us consider the motion in the system, where $C$ is at rest. Red and blue particles move symmetrically in that system; let us consider the red particle. Due to the inertial force $F_{i}=$ $m a=E q / 2$, the equilibrium position of the red particle is shifted (the half-spring is to be deformed by $x=F_{i} / 2 k=E q / 4 k$ to achieve the equilibrium); the particle starts from rest, apart from the equilibrium. So, it starts oscillations, the circular frequency being given by $\\omega=\\sqrt{2 k / m}$ (the factor 2 accounts for the fact that oscillations take place around the center of the spring and half-spring has twice larger stiffness). For the dumbbell to return with the same velocity as it approached, the residual oscillations must be absent (otherwise, some part of the initial kinetic energy would be turned into the oscillations energy, so that the center of mass velocity would be decreased).

        "solution": "The heat flux radiated from one wall is partially reflected back by other wall, which is also partially reflected back, etc. Besides, the flux from the outer wall can hit itself, if it misses the inner wall. So, near the surface of the outer wall, we can split the heat flux into inwards flux $Q_{i}$ and outwards flux $Q_{o}$. Then, upon designating the flux radiated by the outer wall by $Q=\\varepsilon \\sigma S_{2} T_{2}^{4}$, we have equalities $Q_{i}=Q+Q_{o}(1-\\varepsilon),$ i.e. the inward flux consists of (a) inital radiation, and of (b) the back-reflected part of the outwards flux. Similarly we have $Q_{o}=Q_{i} \\kappa(1-\\varepsilon)+Q_{i}(1-\\kappa)=Q_{i}(1-\\kappa \\varepsilon),$ i.e. the outward flux consists of (a) the part $\\kappa$ of itself, which hits the inner wall and is reflected back, and of (b) the part $1-\\kappa$ of itself, which misses the inner wall hence reaches again the outer wall as an outwards flux. Upon substituting $Q_{o}$ from the second equation into the first one, we obtain $Q=Q_{i}[1-(1-\\kappa \\varepsilon)(1-\\varepsilon)]=Q_{i} \\varepsilon(1+\\kappa-\\kappa \\varepsilon)$ hence $Q_{i}=Q / \\varepsilon(1+\\kappa-\\varepsilon)$. From that inwards flux, the part which hits the inner wall is $\\kappa$; in order to get the dissipated part, we need further to multiply the result by $\\varepsilon$. So, the dissipated flux is $Q_{d i}=\\varepsilon \\sigma S_{2} T_{2}^{4} \\kappa /(1+\\kappa-\\kappa \\varepsilon) .$ In order to obtain the flux $Q_{d o}$, which is radiated from the inner wall and is dissipated in the outer wall, we proceed in the same way. Now, let $Q=\\varepsilon \\sigma S_{1} T_{1}^{4}$; then, $Q_{o}=Q+Q_{i}(1-\\kappa \\varepsilon),$ and $Q_{i}=Q_{o}(1-\\varepsilon)$ so that $Q_{o}=Q /[\\varepsilon(1+\\kappa-\\kappa \\varepsilon)]$ and $Q_{d o}=\\varepsilon \\sigma S_{1} T_{1}^{4} /(1+\\kappa-\\kappa \\varepsilon) .$ Now, let us consider (an imaginary) situation, when $T_{1}=T_{2}$. This is thermal equilibrium, when the heat flux $Q_{d o}$ given by the inner wall to the outer one must be equal to the flux $Q_{d i}$, which is given by the outer wall to the inner one. Using our expressions we see that $\\kappa S_{2}=S_{1}$, i.e. $\\kappa=S_{1} / S_{2}$. Now we can finally write down the expression for the net flux given to the nitrogen, $P=Q_{d i}-Q_{d o}=\\frac{\\varepsilon \\sigma 4 \\pi R_{1}^{2}\\left(T_{2}^{4}-T_{1}^{4}\\right)}{1+(1-\\varepsilon) R_{1}^{2} / R_{2}^{2}} \\approx 1.78 \\mathrm{~W}$",

That maximal flight length is found as $s_{\\max }=v t / \\sqrt{2}$, where the flight time $t$ is obtained from the condition $g t=2 v / \\sqrt{2}$. So, $s_{\\max }=v^{2} / g$. This distance gives the radius of the circular region, watered by the sprinkler; its area is $S=\\pi s_{\\max }^{2}=\\pi v^{4} / g^{2}$.  Let us plot the flight distance $s$ as a function of the angle $\\alpha$ at the outlet of the sprinkler. This is a smooth curve with one maximum. For a range of distances from $s$ to $s+\\Delta s$, the amount of received water is (roughly speaking) proportional to the corresponding width of the angle range $\\Delta \\alpha$.

(The capacitor works as a buffer, redistributing the strongly fluctuating current of the previous graph over time, so that the current to the resistor is almost constant.)

If $U_{o}<2 U_{i}$, the ascending branch of the $I_{i}(t)$-graph is steeper than the descending one. So, the sawtooth profile of that graph starts \"climbing up\". The higher it goes, the larger will be $J$ and hence the larger will be $U_{o}$. In its turn, larger $U_{o}$ results in a steeper the descending branch of the $I_{i}(t)$ graph; the process continues until reaching a state when the ascending and descending branches are equally steep; this corresponds to $U_{0}=2 U_{i}$.

Consider triangle $P O A$, where $A$ is defined as the point where the loose end of the rope meets the inner part of the spool at the current moment of time, but which is actually a point of the spool, i.e. it rolls together with the spool) $O$ is the centre of the spool. Let us denote $\\angle P A O=\\beta$; it is easy to see that $\\angle A O P=\\pi-\\alpha$. The velocity $\\vec{v}_{A}$ of the point $A$ is perpendicular to $P A$ and, hence, forms angle $\\beta$ with the loose end of the rope.

When $F$ is small, the top wedgewants to slide downward, so static friction points up the ramp. Considering the horizontal and vertical forces on the block gives $N \\cos \\theta+f \\sin \\theta=m g, \\quad N \\sin \\theta-f \\cos \\theta=m a$. When the minimal forceis applied, the friction is maximal, $f=\\mu N$. Eliminating $N$ gives $m a=m g \\frac{\\sin \\theta-\\mu \\cos \\theta}{\\cos \\theta+\\mu \\sin \\theta}$ and plugging in our first equation gives $F_{\\text {min }}=3 m g\\left(\\mu+\\frac{\\sin \\theta-\\mu \\cos \\theta}{\\cos \\theta+\\mu \\sin \\theta}\\right)=3 m g \\frac{\\left(1+\\mu^2\\right) \\tan \\theta}{1+\\mu \\tan \\theta}$. When $F$ is large, the top wedge wants to slide upward, so static friction points down the ramp, and $N \\cos \\theta-f \\sin \\theta=m g, \\quad N \\sin \\theta+f \\cos \\theta=m a$. Now setting $f=\\mu N$ gives $F_{\\max }=3 m g\\left(\\mu+\\frac{\\sin \\theta+\\mu \\cos \\theta}{\\cos \\theta-\\mu \\sin \\theta}\\right)=3 m g \\frac{2 \\mu+\\left(1-\\mu^2\\right) \\tan \\theta}{1-\\mu \\tan \\theta}$. Therefore, naively the range of forces so that the block will not slip is $F \\in\\left[F_{\\min }, F_{\\max }\\right]$.However, to get full credit, students must account for two edge cases. First, when $\\mu>\\tan \\theta$,no force is required at all to keep the block in place, so the minimum force is zero. Second, when $\\mu>\\cot \\theta$, the block will not slip up under any circumstances, so there is no maximal force. Solution 2. The problem can also be solved geometrically. In general, the no slip condition is $\\mu>\\tan \\phi$ where $\\phi$ is the angle between the vertical and the normal to the plane. Working in the noninertial reference frame of the plane, the fictitious force due to the acceleration is equivalent to a tilting of the gravity vector by an angle $\\tan \\beta=\\frac{a}{g}$ where, as in solution 1, $a=\\frac{F}{3 m}-\\mu g$. Then the top block will not slip as long as $|\\theta-\\beta| \\leq \\phi$. At the minimum acceleration $a_{\\min }, \\beta=\\theta-\\phi$, and taking the tangent of both sides gives $\\frac{a_{\\min }}{g}=\\frac{\\tan \\theta-\\mu}{1+\\mu \\tan \\theta}$. This is only meaningful for $\\tan \\theta>\\mu$, otherwise the answer is simply $a_{\\min }=0$. At the maximum acceleration $a_{\\max }, \\beta=\\theta+\\phi$, which gives $\\frac{a_{\\max }}{g}=\\frac{\\tan \\theta+\\mu}{1-\\mu \\tan \\theta}$. This is only meaningful for $\\cot \\theta>\\mu$, otherwise the answer is simply $a_{\\max }=\\infty$.",

        "solution": "The entropy of an object with constant heat capacity is $S=\\int \\frac{d Q}{T}=C \\int \\frac{d T}{T}=C \\ln T$. Since the total entropy remains constant, $T_1 T_2 T_3$ is constant; this is a direct generalization of the result for $T_f$ found in part (a). Energy is also conserved, as it makes no sense to leave stored energy unused, so $T_1+T_2+T_3$ is constant. When one object is at temperature $T_H$, the other two must be at the same lower temperature $T_0$, or else further work could be extracted from their temperature difference, so $T_1+T_2+T_3=T_H+2 T_0, \\quad T_1 T_2 T_3=T_H T_0^2$. Plugging in temperatures with values divided by 100 for convenience, and eliminating $T_0$ gives $T_H\\left(7-T_H\\right)^2=36$. We know that $T_H=1$ is one (spurious) solution, since this is the minimum possible final temperature as found in part (b). The other roots are $T_H=4$ and $T_H=9$ by the quadratic formula. The solution $T_H=9$ is impossible by energy conservation, so $T_H=400 \\mathrm{~K}$. It is also possible to solve the problem more explicitly. For example, one can run a Carnot cycle between the first two objects until they are at the same temperature, then run a Carnot cycle in reverse between the last two objects using the stored work. At this point, the first two objects will no longer be at the same temperature, so we can repeat the procedure; this yields an infinite series for $T_H$. Some students did this, and took only the first term of the series. This yields a fairly good approximation of $T_H \\approx 395 \\mathrm{~K}$. Another explicit method is to continuously switch between running one Carnot engine forward and another Carnot engine in reverse; this yields three differential equations for $T_1, T_2$, and $T_3$. Solving the equations and setting $T_1=T_2$ yields $T_3=T_H$.",

We set $c=1$ throughout, and transform to an inertial frame where the proton is initially at rest. Before the collision, $E_p=m_p, \\quad E_\\gamma=\\left|p_\\gamma\\right|$. For the $\\Delta$ particle, we have the usual relativistic relation $E_{\\Delta}^2=p_{\\Delta}^2+m_{\\Delta}^2$. By energy-momentum conservation, $E_p+E_\\gamma=E_{\\Delta}, \\quad p_\\gamma=p_{\\Delta}$. Combining these results gives $\\left(m_p+E_\\gamma\\right)^2=E_\\gamma^2+m_{\\Delta}^2 \\Rightarrow E_\\gamma=\\frac{m_{\\Delta}^2-m_p^2}{2 m_p}$. Now we need to transform back to the original frame, where the energy of the photon is $E_b$. We can use the Lorentz transformation for this, but it's a little easier to realize that $E=h f$ for photons, and apply the Doppler shift. Then $\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{E_b}{E_\\gamma}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}}$ where $\\beta$ is the velocity parameter of the proton in the inertial frame where the photon has energy $E_b$. Solving for $\\beta$ in terms of the energy ratio $\\alpha$, $\\beta=\\frac{1-\\alpha^2}{1+\\alpha^2}$.To calculate the proton energy, we need the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}}=\\frac{1+\\alpha^2}{2 \\alpha}$.Then the proton energy in the original frame is $E_p=\\gamma m_p=\\frac{m_p}{2}\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)=\\frac{m_p}{2}\\left(\\frac{2 m_p E_b}{m_{\\Delta}^2-m_p^2}+\\frac{m_{\\Delta}^2-m_p^2}{2 m_p E_b}\\right)$ which is the exact answer. At this point, we can approximate. The second term is much larger than the first, so $E_p \\approx \\frac{m_{\\Delta}^2-m_p^2}{4 E_b}$ which was the required answer for this problem. Solution 2. We now show another method that approximates throughout. We'll do everything in the lab frame, so the symbols in this solution don't mean the same things they did in solution 1 . In the lab frame, energy-momentum conservation gives $p_p-p_b=p_{\\Delta}, \\quad E_p+E_b=E_{\\Delta}$. Squaring both expressions and dropping $E_b^2$ terms, since $E_b$ is small, $p_p^2-2 p_p p_b \\approx p_{\\Delta}^2, \\quad E_p^2+2 E_p E_b \\approx E_{\\Delta}^2$. Subtracting these equations gives $m_p^2+2 E_p E_b+2 p_p E_b=m_{\\Delta}^2 \\Rightarrow E_p+p_p=\\frac{m_{\\Delta}^2-m_p^2}{2 E_b}$. Since $E_b$ is small, this quantity must be large.

        "solution": "First we'll look for the height $H$ at which we should push to topple the domino with the least momentum. A convenient method is to look at the angular momentum in the domino because this is easy to calculate and describes rotational motion. Because the push is horizontal, the moment arm of the push (about the domino's rotational axis) is purely vertical. That means the angular momentum of the push is $p H$, where $p$ is the momentum imparted and $H$ is the height of the push. There is some minimum angular momentum $L_{\\min }$ to topple the domino, so we set $L_{\\min }=p H$. The bigger $H$, the smaller $p$, so we should choose the largest possible $H$. In other words, we should push at the very top of the domino, $H=h$. While we're on this part, note that if the push weren't constrained to be horizontal, the push could be a little bit smaller since the moment arm could be the entire diagonal of the thin edge of the domino. Next we calculate the minimum $p$ using energy. As the domino rotates, it converts kinetic energy to potential energy, so we'll calculate both. The domino's potential energy is greatest when its center of mass is directly over the contact point of the domino and the table. That height is half the diagonal of the domino, so the distance from the contact point to the center of the domino is $\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{t^2+h^2}$. From the push until it reaches this point, the domino's potential energy increases by $\\Delta U=\\frac{1}{2} m g\\left(\\sqrt{t^2+h^2}-h\\right)$. Then the domino topples. By conservation of energy, $\\Delta U$ is how much rotational kinetic energy the domino must have begun with. Next we find the kinetic energy using the rotational kinetic energy formula, $T=L^2 / 2 I$. The moment of inertia of the domino about its contact point with the table is $I=\\frac{1}{3} m\\left(h^2+t^2\\right)$.You can find this with an integral, or if you know the moment of inertia about the center $\\left(\\frac{1}{12} m\\left(h^2+t^2\\right)\\right)$, you can use the parallel axis theorem. We know the momentum $L=p h$, so the kinetic energy is $T=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{L^2}{I}=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(p h)^2}{(1 / 3) m\\left(h^2+t^2\\right)}=\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{p^2 h^2}{m\\left(h^2+t^2\\right)}$.

Let the dominoes' angular velocities be $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ respectively. After the dominoes collide, they stick together.

For the second domino it is $\\omega_2$ times the height of the impact point, so $\\omega_2 \\sqrt{h^2-l^2}$. Because these velocity components must be equal, $\\omega_1=\\omega_2$. This means the dominoes have the same angular momentum as each other, measured relative to their respective rotation axes. If we look at the collision, the forces between the dominoes are purely horizontal because the dominoes' faces are frictionless, so they only exert normal forces. The second domino is vertical, so all its normal forces are purely horizontal. These horizontal normal forces exchange angular momentum between the two dominoes. They have the same moment arm (i.e. the height of the collision), so the amount of angular momentum transferred out of the first domino is equal to the amount gained by the second domino, both measured relative to the dominoes' respective rotation axes. Because the dominoes are identical and have the same angular velocity, they have the same angular momentum. This means each domino has half as much angular momentum about its rotation axis as the first domino had just before the collision. (Note that forces from the table cannot change the angular momentum of the dominoes about their respective rotational axes because such forces have zero moment arm, so only the inter-domino forces need to be examined here.)Kinetic energy scales with the square of angular momentum, so each domino has a quarter as much kinetic energy after the collision as the first domino had before it.

The top left corner of the second domino moves horizontally forward by $h \\sin (\\phi+\\beta)+t(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\beta))$. We ignore the cosine term as second order in the rotation angle and approximate this as $h(\\phi+\\beta)$. The $y$-coordinate of the upper right corner of the first domino is $h(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\alpha)) \\approx h$. The $y$-coordinate of the upper left corner of the second domino is $h(1-\\cos (\\phi+\\beta))+t \\sin (\\phi+\\beta) \\approx$ $h+t(\\phi+\\beta)$ There is a first-order difference in $y$-coordinates of the two corners, but this means the difference in $x$ coordinate between the top left corner of the second domino and the top right corner of the first domino is second-order in the rotation angles. We conclude that to first order $h(\\phi+\\alpha)=l+h(\\phi+\\beta) \\Rightarrow \\alpha=\\frac{l}{h}+\\beta$ because this condition puts the top right corner of the first domino at the same position as the top left of the second domino. The potential energy of the first domino, setting zero potential energy to be when the domino is upright, is $U_1=\\Delta U\\left(1-(\\alpha / \\phi)^2\\right)$ to second order in $\\alpha$, and for the second domino, $U_2=$ $\\Delta U\\left(1-(\\beta / \\phi)^2\\right)$. These figures come from fitting a quadratic whose peak is when the center of mass is above the rotation point and which is zero when the domino is upright. The total potential energy is $U_1+U_2$, and using the relation between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, it is minimized for $\\beta_{\\max }=-\\frac{l}{2 h}$. In other words, the second domino is as far away from rotating to the top of arc as the first domino has rotated past the top of its arc. This gives a maximum potential energy $U_{\\max }=2 \\Delta U\\left(1-\\frac{l^2}{4 t^2}\\right)$ where we have used the approximation $\\phi \\approx t / h$.At impact, $U_{\\text {impact }} \\approx \\Delta U\\left(-l^2 / t^2+2 l / t\\right)$. Before impact, the kinetic energy is $\\Delta U-U_{\\text {impact }}$ because the maximum potential energy before impact was $\\Delta U$, and the kinetic energy was zero there. The kinetic energy just after the collision is then $\\left(\\Delta U-U_{\\text {impact }}\\right) / 2$. Setting this equal to the potential energy gain as the two dominoes rotate to their highest potential energy $U_{\\max }\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\Delta U-U_{\\text {impact }}\\right)=U_{\\max }-U_{\\text {impact }}$ or $\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta U=U_{\\max }-\\frac{1}{2} U_{\\text {impact }}$. Plugging in the earlier expressions for all these gives $\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta U=2 \\Delta U\\left(1-\\frac{l^2}{4 t^2}\\right)-\\Delta U\\left(\\frac{l}{t}-\\frac{l^2}{2 t^2}\\right)$ and solving this yields $l=\\frac{3}{2} t$ to first order in $t$.",

        "problem": "A heat engine consists of a moveable piston in a vertical cylinder. The piston is held in place by a removable weight placed on top of the piston, but piston stops prevent the piston from sinking below a certain point. The mass of the piston is $m=40.0 \\mathrm{~kg}$, the cross sectional area of the piston is $A=100 \\mathrm{~cm}^2$, and the weight placed on the piston has a mass of $m=120.0 \\mathrm{~kg}$. Assume that the region around the cylinder and piston is a vacuum, so you don't need to worry about external atmospheric pressure. - At point $\\mathbf{A}$ the cylinder volume $V_0$ is completely filled with liquid water at a temperature $T_0=320 \\mathrm{~K}$ and a pressure $P_{\\min }$ that would be just sufficient to lift the piston alone, except the piston has the additional weight placed on top.- Heat energy is added to the water by placing the entire cylinder in a hot bath.- At point $\\mathbf{B}$ the piston and weight begins to rise.- At point $\\mathbf{C}$ the volume of the cylinder reaches $V_{\\max }$ and the temperature reaches $400 \\mathrm{~K}$. The heat source is removed; the piston stops rising and is locked in place.- Heat energy is now removed from the water by placing the entire cylinder in a cold bath.- At point $\\mathbf{D}$ the pressure in the cylinder returns to $P_{\\min }$. The added weight is removed; the piston is unlocked and begins to move down.- The cylinder volume returns to $V_0$. The cylinder is removed from the cold bath, the weight is placed back on top of the piston, and the cycle repeats.Because the liquid water can change to gas, there are several important events that take place- At point $\\mathbf{W}$ the liquid begins changing to gas.- At point $\\mathbf{X}$ all of the liquid has changed to gas. This may not occur the same as point $\\mathbf{C}$ described above.- At point $\\mathbf{Y}$ the gas begins to change back into liquid.- At point $\\mathbf{Z}$ all of the gas has changed back into liquid.When in the liquid state you need to know that for water kept at constant volume, a change in temperature $\\Delta T$ is related to a change in pressure $\\Delta P$ according to $\\Delta P \\approx\\left(10^6 \\mathrm{~Pa} / \\mathrm{K}\\right) \\Delta T$.

        "solution": "Before we get started solving the problem, let's say a bit about where the data in the problem comes from. We are using the Magnus form to approximate the coexistence curve, $P=(610.94 \\mathrm{~Pa}) e^{17.625 /(1+243.04 / T)}$ where $T$ is measured in centigrade. This is closely related to the result that can be derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for ideal gases, $P=P_0 e^{\\frac{L}{R}\\left(\\frac{T-T_0}{T T_0}\\right)}$ where we assume the temperature is low compared to the critical temperature and the latent heat $L$ is a constant. To get $\\Delta P / \\Delta T$, we used the cyclic chain rule $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial V}\\right)_P=-1$ where subscripts indicate what is being held constant. Dropping those for convenience, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}=\\left(-V \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{V} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)=\\frac{\\beta_{V T}}{\\beta_{P V}} \\approx \\frac{\\left(6 \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}\\right)}{\\left(5 \\times 10^{-10} \\mathrm{~Pa}^{-1}\\right)} \\approx 10^6 \\mathrm{~Pa} / \\mathrm{K}$. The specific value is not important; the point is that a very small change in the temperature of the liquid in a fixed volume will result in a very large change in the pressure.We start by computing pressures. The minimum pressure is attained when only the piston is to be lifted, so $P_{\\text {min }}=\\frac{F}{A}=\\frac{m g}{A}=\\frac{(40 \\mathrm{~kg})\\left(10 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2\\right)}{\\left(0.01 \\mathrm{~m}^2\\right)}=40 \\mathrm{kPa}$. The maximum pressure is attained when lifting the piston with extra weight, $P_{\\max }=\\frac{F}{A}=\\frac{m g}{A}=\\frac{(160 \\mathrm{~kg})\\left(10 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2\\right)}{\\left(0.01 \\mathrm{~m}^2\\right)}=160 \\mathrm{kPa}$. Point A is clearly at $\\left(P_{\\min }, T_0\\right)$ on the PT graph. For liquid water a small temperature increase results in a large pressure increase, so point B is effectively at the same temperature as point A. Process A $\\rightarrow$ B is therefore essentially isothermal, and it is also a constant volume process. Afterwards, the pressure is sufficient to lift the piston and weight, so the volume expands at constant pressure for the process $\\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{C}$. However, liquid cannot change to gas until we reach the coexistence curve. This defines the location of point W. On the PT graph we are 'stuck' on the coexistence curve until all the liquid has changed into gas, so $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{C}$ are also at the same point. Upon reaching $\\mathrm{C}$ the piston is locked in place, fixing the volume, and the cylinder is allowed to cool. To figure out what happens, suppose water vapor obeyed the ideal gas law $P V=n R T$. For a constant volume process, $T \\propto P$, so the path would be a straight line towards the origin of the $P T$ diagram. This isn't what happens here, because we run into the coexistence curve, and the pressure is decreased by some of the gas condensing to liquid. Thus during the entire $\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{D}$ process, we follow the coexistence curve downward; it is impossible to cross it until all of the vapor condenses. The next process $\\mathrm{C} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{D}$ is constant volume, but not isothermal. On the PT graph we follow the coexistence curve to the minimum pressure, at which time the piston is freed and allowed to lower at constant pressure. Since $\\mathrm{Z}$ is the point where all of the gas has changed to liquid, it must be on the coexistence curve. On the PV diagram it is just to the right of point A.",

        "problem": "For this problem, assume the existence of a hypothetical particle known as a magnetic monopole. Such a particle would have a 'magnetic charge' $q_m$, and in analogy to an electrically charged particle would produce a radially directed magnetic field of magnitude $B=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_m}{r^2}$ and be subject to a force (in the absence of electric fields) $F=q_m B$. A magnetic monopole of mass $m$ and magnetic charge $q_m$ is constrained to move on a vertical, nonmagnetic, insulating, frictionless U-shaped track. At the bottom of the track is a wire loop whose radius $b$ is much smaller than the width of the 'U' of the track. The section of track near the loop can thus be approximated as a long straight line. The wire that makes up the loop has radius $a \\ll b$ and resistivity $\\rho$. The monopole is released from rest a height $H$ above the bottom of the track. Ignore the self-inductance of the loop, and assume that the monopole passes through the loop many times before coming to a rest.Suppose the monopole is a distance $x$ from the center of the loop.

However, by Gauss's law the flux will remain the same if we deform this surface, as long as we keep its boundary the same and don't hit the monopole. The easiest way is to deform the surface so it is part of a sphere of radius $r=\\sqrt{b^2+x^2}$ centered at the monopole. Work in spherical coordinates, where $\\theta$ is the angle to the $x$-axis and $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. The loop itself is at $\\theta_0=\\tan ^{-1}(b / x)$, so $\\Phi_B=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_m}{r^2} \\int_0^{2 \\pi} d \\phi \\int_0^{\\theta_0} r^2 \\sin \\theta d \\theta=\\frac{\\mu_0 q_m}{2}\\left(1-\\cos \\left(\\theta_0\\right)\\right)$. We can easily check this by limiting cases: for small $x$ we have $\\mu_0 q_m / 2$, i.e. half of the total flux, while for large $x$ we have zero flux. This form is acceptable, but we can also write it explicitly in terms of $x$.

We use the Biot-Savart law, $\\mathbf{B}=\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4 \\pi} \\int \\frac{d \\mathbf{s} \\times \\mathbf{r}}{r^3}$ where $\\mathbf{r}$ is a vector from the monopole to a point on the rim, $d \\mathbf{s}$ integrates along the loop, and $r=\\sqrt{b^2+x^2}$ as before. Since $d \\mathbf{s} \\times \\mathbf{r}=r \\sin \\theta d s$, the integral gives $B=\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4 \\pi} \\frac{2 \\pi b \\sin \\theta}{r^2}=\\frac{\\mu_0 I}{2 b} \\sin ^3 \\theta$.

Then $a=\\frac{\\mu_0^2 q_m^2 v}{4 b^2 m R} \\sin ^6 \\theta$.

Finally, we need to find $R$. Since $a \\ll b$, the loop is approximately a long cylindrical wire, so $R=\\rho \\frac{2 \\pi b}{\\pi a^2}$ which gives the final result $\\Delta v=-\\frac{3 \\pi}{64} \\frac{\\mu_0^2 q_m^2 a^2}{b^2 m \\rho}$. We haven't kept track of the signs very carefully; all that matters is that $\\Delta v$ is negative, as it must be by Lenz's law. The problem can also be solved by energy conservation, finding the energy dissipated in the loop every trip by integrating $P=\\mathcal{E}^2 / R$ over time, then relating that to the change in the monopole's kinetic energy, $\\Delta K \\approx m v \\Delta v$. If we had kept the integral above over $d x$, we would instead have to use the first provided integral. Incidentally, these integrals aren't too hard to derive.

Note that the 13 arcsecond notation is not needed for this computation, it simply is a comparison of the size of the object as seen from Earth. As such, seen from Earth, the orbital dust ring subtends about the same angle as does the planet Jupiter! A quick estimate yields $R_b / R_e \\approx 110$, while slightly more work is required for the periods. The inset box is 10 times the scale of the main image. The planet moves 1.4 AU during the two year period. Since the orbital circumference is $690 \\mathrm{AU}$, that means it takes 980 years to complete an orbit. Then $T_b / T_e=980$, and $M_b / M_s \\approx 1.4$. Allowing for $10 \\%$ error in each measurement, the results would be between 0.87 and 2.2.

Inserting the conducting plate can be treated two ways: it results in the creation of two capacitors, in series, each with area $A$ but differing separation. The net charge $Q_0$ won't change, that's why we needed it above, but the resulting capacitance of the system will be $1 / C_e=1 / C_1+1 / C_2$.For our capacitors, the only thing that changes is $d$, which we'll call $x_1$ and $x_2$.

On the up trip, the equilibrium point is clearly at a distance $L / 2$ from $B$, since the plate stops at both $B$ and $A$ and hence those are the endpoints of the oscillation and the equilibrium is halfway between. For the trip down, the equilibrium point will shift by a distance $y$ such that$k y=2 \\mu m g \\cos \\theta=m g \\sin \\theta$because $2 \\mu m g \\cos \\theta$ is the difference between the friction forces on the trip up and the trip down. The place where the plate finally comes to a stop is the first place that is at the end of an oscillation (either up or down) and where the total force being exerted by gravity and the spring is less than the maximal force of friction. For that to happen, the plate needs to not have gone past the other equilibrium point during that oscillation. So we start by determining where the endpoints of the oscillations are. For the first trip up these are $B$ and $A$. For the following trip down, the plate stops at a distance of $(2 m g \\sin \\theta) / k$ from $B$ (because the equilibrium shifts up by $(m g \\sin \\theta) / k$.

If the two faces of a slab of material with thermal conductivity $\\kappa$, area $A$, and thickness $d$ are held at temperatures differing by $\\Delta T$, the thermal power $P$ transferred through the slab is $P=\\frac{\\kappa A \\Delta T}{d}$. A heat exchanger is a device which transfers heat between a hot fluid and a cold fluid; they are common in industrial applications such as power plants and heating systems. The heat exchanger shown below consists of two rectangular tubes of length $l$, width $w$, and height $h$. The tubes are separated by a metal wall of thickness $d$ and thermal conductivity $\\kappa$. Originally hot fluid flows through the lower tube at a speed $v$ from right to left, and originally cold fluid flows through the upper tube in the opposite direction (left to right) at the same speed. The heat capacity per unit volume of both fluids is $c$. The hot fluid enters the heat exchanger at a higher temperature than the cold fluid; the difference between the temperatures of the entering fluids is $\\Delta T_i$. When the fluids exit the heat exchanger the difference has been reduced to $\\Delta T_f$. (It is possible for the exiting originally cold fluid to have a higher temperature than the exiting originally hot fluid, in which case $\\Delta T_f<0$.)Assume that the temperature in each pipe depends only on the lengthwise position, and consider transfer of heat only due to conduction in the metal and due to the bulk movement of fluid. Under the assumptions in this problem, while the temperature of each fluid varies along the length of the exchanger, the temperature difference across the wall is the same everywhere. You need not prove this. Find $\\Delta T_f$ in terms of the other given parameters.",

        "solution": "To see why the temperature difference across the wall is the same everywhere along the wall, note that at every point along the wall, the warmer fluid on one side transfers energy to the colder fluid on the other. Since the heat capacities are equal, the temperature of the warmer fluid drops at the same rate the temperature of the colder fluid rises. But since the fluids move at the same speed in opposite directions, this means the temperature difference is constant. Suppose this temperature difference is $\\Delta T_w$. Since the total area of the wall is $l w$, the power transferred across the wall is $P=\\frac{\\kappa l w}{d} \\Delta T_w$. In a time $d t$, the energy transferred is therefore $d E=\\frac{\\kappa l w}{d} \\Delta T_w d t$. Meanwhile, suppose the red fluid enters at temperature $T_r$ and the blue fluid at temperature $T_b$. The red fluid exits at temperature $T_b+\\Delta T_w$, so the overall temperature change of the red fluid is $\\Delta T_r=T_r-\\left(T_b+\\Delta T_w\\right)=\\Delta T_i-\\Delta T_w$. In a time $d t$, a volume of red fluid $v w h d t$ enters the pipe, and the same volume leaves, with a temperature $\\Delta T_r$ higher. Then the total energy transferred to the red fluid is $d E=v w h c d t \\Delta T_r=v w h c\\left(\\Delta T_i-\\Delta T_w\\right) d t$. We would get the same equation if we considered the blue fluid, as expected by energy conservation. However, this requires $v w h c$ to be the same for both fluids. If this were not true, we would instead get a contradiction, reflecting the fact that $\\Delta T_w$ could not be constant. Equating our two expressions for $d E$ gives $\\frac{\\kappa l w}{d} \\Delta T_w=v w h c\\left(\\Delta T_i-\\Delta T_w\\right) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta T_w=\\frac{\\Delta T_i}{1+\\alpha}, \\quad \\alpha=\\frac{\\kappa l}{d v h c}$. Because the red fluid exits at $T_b+\\Delta T_w$ and the blue fluid exits at $T_r-\\Delta T_w$, $\\Delta T_f=\\left(T_b+\\Delta T_w\\right)-\\left(T_r-\\Delta T_w\\right)=-\\Delta T_i+2 \\Delta T_w=\\Delta T_i\\left(\\frac{2}{1+\\alpha}-1\\right)$. The performance of the heat exchanger is determined by the dimensionless parameter $\\alpha$. There are several ways we can check this result. We can check if $\\alpha$ is correct by dimensional analysis or common sense; for example, it's clear that a long pipe improves performance. We also see that in the limit of poor performance, $\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$, we find no heat exchange at all, $\\Delta T_f=\\Delta T_i$. The best possible performance, attained for $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$, is $\\Delta T_f=-\\Delta T_i$, a complete reversal of the temperatures of the fluids. This is much better than the best possible performance if the two fluids moved the same direction, which would be $\\Delta T_f=0$. The general idea here is called countercurrent heat exchange, and it appears in both biology and practical engineering.",

We know there is no oil at $t=0$, because the oil level and water level coincide, and we know that the rate of change of the oil level for $t>6 \\mathrm{~min}$ is the pour rate, because the water level is not changing. Extrapolating to $t=0$ we conclude that the volume of oil in the container at any time is given by the height of the shaded region. The volume of displaced oil is thus the distance between the solid and dashed lines, $186 \\mathrm{~mL}$. The density of the oil is thus $\\rho_o=\\rho_w \\frac{\\Delta V_w}{\\Delta V_o}=(1.00 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}) \\frac{143 \\mathrm{~mL}}{186 \\mathrm{~mL}}=0.77 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$. Note there is not enough information to find the density of the duck.",

        "problem": "Shown below is the Blackbird, a vehicle built in 2009. There is no source of stored energy such as a battery or gasoline engine; all of the power used to move the car comes from the wind. The only important mechanism in the car is a gearbox that can transfer power between the wheels and the propeller. The Blackbird was driven both directly downwind and directly upwind, as shown below. In each case the car remained exactly parallel (or anti-parallel) to the wind without turning. The tests were conducted on level ground, in steady, uniform wind, and continued long enough to reach the steady state.When driving downwind, the builders claim that they were able to drive 'faster than the wind': that is, with $|\\vec{v}|>\\left|\\vec{v}_w\\right|$, so that the car experienced a relative headwind while traveling. Commenters on the Internet claimed, often angrily, that this was physically impossible and that the Blackbird was a hoax. Some commenters also claimed that the upwind case was physically impossible.Consider first the downwind faster than the wind case. - Is the motion actually possible as claimed? If not, offer a brief explanation!- If the motion is possible, is power transferred from the propeller to the wheels or vice versa?- If the motion is possible, what ground speed is attained? For this question, suppose that when transferring power in either direction between the propeller and the wheels, a fraction $\u0007lpha$ of the useful work is lost; let the wind speed be $v_w$. Neglect all other losses of energy. Answer the previous questions for the upwind case.",

        "solution": "Both modes are possible as claimed. The solution uses the idea of 'center of mass (CoM) power', which we will review below for interested readers; the solution itself starts on the next page. For simplicity, we will work in one dimension. If a particle moves with speed $v_1$ and experiences a force $F$, then the rate of change of its kinetic energy is $P_1=F v_1$. Suppose this force is exerted by an interaction with a second particle, which moves with speed $v^{\\prime}$. The rate of change of its kinetic energy is $P_2=-F v_2$ by Newton's third law, and the total is $P=P_1+P_2=F v_1-F v_2=F v_r$ where $v_r$ is the relative velocity. If we move into a different reference frame, both $P_1$ and $P_2$ change, but $P$ stays the same, as all frames agree on the relative velocity. This is straightforward, but it becomes more subtle when applied to a system more complicated than a particle. The speed $v$ becomes the speed of the point of application of the force, while the power $P$ must be generalized to include internal energy. We will write the energy of a system as $E=E_{\\mathrm{cm}}+E_{\\text {int }}$, where the 'center of mass energy' $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}=M v_{\\mathrm{cm}}^2 / 2$ is the kinetic energy associated with the motion of the CoM, and $E_{\\text {int }}$ accounts for everything else, such as the rotational energy of a wheel or propeller.) As an example, consider an accelerating bicycle. The force that pushes the bicycle forward is the friction force with the ground. However, if the wheels are rolling without slipping, then at every moment, the relative velocity between the ground and the part of the wheel touching the ground is exactly zero. Thus the power is zero, so $E$ is constant. This is because the increase in $E_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ is compensated by a decrease in the chemical energy of the cyclist, accounted for in $E_{\\text {int }}$. Thus energy arguments appear to tell us nothing useful about the motion of the bicycle. Similarly, energy arguments tell us nothing definite about the Blackbird's wheels or propellers. It is more useful here to use 'center of mass power'. This concept is not covered in most textbooks, but interested readers can consult section 13.5 of Halliday, Resnick, and Krane, $5^{\\text {th }}$ edition. The idea behind CoM power is that the CoM of a system satisfies $F=M a_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ where $F$ is the total force on the system. This is essentially the same equation as we would have for a single particle of mass $m$, so by the same proof of the work-kinetic energy theory for particles, $P_{\\mathrm{cm}}=F v_{\\mathrm{cm}}, \\quad P_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\frac{d E_{\\mathrm{cm}}}{d t}$. The CoM power $P_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ only contributes to the CoM energy. Crucially, it only depends on the velocity of the center of mass, not on any other details of the system. Now consider two systems interacting by a force $F$, whose centers of mass move at a relative velocity of $v_r$. By the same argument as above, the net CoM power is $P_{\\mathrm{cm}}=F v_r$.By conservation of energy, this change in CoM energy must be compensated by an opposite change in the internal energy. Now we turn to the analysis of the downwind case. We take all velocities to be positive. In the steady state, the velocity of the Blackbird is constant, so the force $F$ on the propeller is balanced by a force $-F$ on the wheels. For the system of the propellers and air, we have $P_{\\mathrm{cm}}=F\\left(v-v_w\\right) \\text {. }$ By energy conservation, the internal energy of the propellers and air must change at the rate $P_{\\text {prop }}=F\\left(v_w-v\\right) \\text {. }$ Since we have assumed no extraneous energy losses, the internal energy of the air doesn't increase at all, so this is just the change in the internal energy of the propeller. By similar reasoning, the internal energy of the wheels and ground must change at the rate $P_{\\text {wheel }}=F v$ and again, since there are no extraneous energy losses, this is the rate of change of the internal energy of the wheels. Now we determine the sign of $F$. If the Blackbird moves downwind faster than the wind, $v>v_w$, then $P_{\\text {wheel }}$ and $P_{\\text {prop }}$ have opposite signs, with $\\left|P_{\\text {wheel }}\\right|>\\left|P_{\\text {prop }}\\right|$. Thus, the force $F$ should be positive, in the direction of the wind, so that $P_{\\text {wheel }}$ is positive and $P_{\\text {prop }}$ is negative. That is, power is transferred from the wheels to the propeller. In general, power should always be produced by the force with the larger relative velocity. In the steady state the total internal energy of the Blackbird is constant, so $\\left|P_{\\text {prop }}\\right|=(1-\\alpha) P_{\\text {wheel }} \\Rightarrow v=v_w / \\alpha$. With sufficiently low energy loss, any speed is possible. The argument here is somewhat counterintuitive. A tempting (but incorrect) counterargument is that, since the internal energy of the Blackbird ultimately comes from a decrease in the centerof-mass energy of the air, which is slowed down by the propeller, the internal energy must always be supplied by the propeller. One way to see this argument doesn't work is to note that in the reference frame where the air is still and the ground is moving, the same argument would suggest that internal energy must always be supplied by the wheels. The point is that changes of center-of-mass energy are completely different in different reference frames, as mentioned above. They cannot be used to determine the direction of flow of internal energy, which does not depend on the reference frame. In all frames, the force of the wind slows the rotation of the propeller, and hence power must be transferred from the wheels to the propeller. We now consider the upwind case. We'll keep all the sign conventions the same, except we'll take $v$ be the leftward speed of the Blackbird. Then $P_{\\text {prop }}=F\\left(v+v_w\\right), \\quad P_{\\text {wheel }}=-F v$. Since $\\left|P_{\\text {prop }}\\right|>\\left|P_{\\text {wheel }}\\right|$, power is transferred from the propeller to the wheels, and we again have $F>0$, i.e. in both cases the force on the propeller is in the direction of the wind, as expected. The energy balance equation is $\\left|P_{\\text {wheel }}\\right|=(1-\\alpha) P_{\\text {prop }} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v=v_w\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}-1\\right)$. Again, with sufficiently low energy loss, any speed is possible.",

        "solution": "The main effect is that the ice radiates heat into the air due to the temperature gradient through it, and this freezes the water next to the ice. However, there are many other effects that slightly change the answer. i. There is another contribution to the thermal power from the temperature gradient in the water. ii. As the water freezes, it lifts the ice above it. iii. When a layer of water freezes into ice, all of the other water and ice becomes slightly colder. The first point should be addressed for full credit. To do this, we will calculate both contributions. The water right at the bottom of the ice is at $0 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}$. The temperature gradients in the water and ice are both uniform since the system is in quasi-equilibrium; physically, if the temperature gradient were not uniform, there would be a net flow of heat to or away from some regions, quickly making the gradient uniform again. The temperature gradient in the water is $4 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ} / 5 \\mathrm{~m}$. Multiplying by the conductivity, we get a power of $P_w=\\frac{4 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}}{5 \\mathrm{~m}} \\frac{0.57 \\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{mC}^{\\circ}}=0.456 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^2$ delivered through the water. The same calculation for the ice gives power $P_i=\\frac{10 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}}{.01 \\mathrm{~m}} \\frac{2.2 \\mathrm{~W}}{\\mathrm{~m} \\cdot \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}}=2200 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{m}^2$ delivered through the ice. Thus $P_w$ is negligible and can be ignored. Now, each square meter of water directly underneath the ice loses $2200 \\mathrm{~J}$ of energy per second. That is enough energy to freeze $2200 \\mathrm{~W} /(330,000 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{kg})=6.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{s}$ of water into ice. Converting to volume, we have $\\left(6.7 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{s}\\right) /\\left(920 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^3\\right)=7.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m}^3 / \\mathrm{s}$ of ice formed for each square meter of ice, which means the ice is growing at a rate $r=7.2 \\times 10^{-6} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}=2.6 \\mathrm{~cm} / \\mathrm{hr}$. Next, we will account for the second and third points; these are not necessary for full credit. First consider the rising of the water. Each square meter of ice initially weighs $9.2 \\mathrm{~kg}$. A power of $2200 \\mathrm{~W}$ is enough to lift this ice about $24 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ against gravity. In reality, the ice is lifted at a much slower rate, so this accounts for a negligible portion of the energy. The third point requires some more explanation. In an appropriate coordinate system, the temperature profile of the ice is $T(x, d)=\\left(1-\\frac{x}{d}\\right) \\delta T, \\quad x \\in[0, d]$ where $d$ is the thickness and $\\delta T=-10 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}$. As the thickness $d$ increases, all of the ice must decrease slightly in temperature to maintain a linear temperature gradient, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial d}=\\frac{x}{d^2} \\delta T$. By drawing a graph, one can see this contribution is equal to the heat that would be needed to cool the new ice formed by $5 \\mathrm{C}^{\\circ}$, which gives a $3 \\%$ correction to the answer. There is also a similar contribution from cooling the water, which is negligible. Finally, we neglected the sublimation of the ice.",

The second equation yields $t=\\frac{R}{v} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$ and plugging this into the first equation gives $R+R \\cos \\theta=\\frac{1}{2} g\\left(\\frac{R}{v} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}\\right)^2-v \\sin \\theta \\frac{R}{v} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$ which simplifies to $1+\\cos \\theta=\\frac{g R}{2 v^2} \\frac{\\sin ^2 \\theta}{\\cos \\theta}$. Now, the ball leaves the surface when the normal component of the force of the loop on the ball just drops to zero. This happens when $m g \\cos \\theta=m \\frac{v^2}{R} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{v^2}{g R}=\\cos \\theta$ and plugging this into the previous equation gives $1+\\cos \\theta=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1-\\cos ^2 \\theta}{\\cos ^2 \\theta} \\Rightarrow 2 \\cos ^2 \\theta=1-\\cos \\theta$. This is a quadratic equation with solutions $\\cos \\theta=\\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+8}}{4}=-\\frac{1}{4} \\pm \\frac{3}{4}$. Only the positive answer of $\\cos \\theta=1 / 2$ is relevant here, though the negative answer is still physical! Now that we know $\\theta$, getting the final answer is straightforward. We combine the energy conservation equation and the condition $m g \\cos \\theta=m \\frac{v^2}{R}$ to find $h=1+\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\beta)+1\\right) R \\cos \\theta=\\frac{37}{20} R$.",

Then by ordinary kinematics, $c t_1=d-\\frac{1}{2} g t_1^2, \\quad c\\left(t_2-\\tau\\right)=\\frac{1}{2} g \\tau^2+d-\\frac{1}{2} g t_2^2$.Note that we are ignoring time dilation effects because they are second order in the velocity, and hence second order in $g$. Now subtracting these equations, we have $c\\left(t_2-t_1-\\tau\\right)=\\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\tau^2+t_1^2-t_2^2\\right)$. Defining $\\Delta t=t_2-t_1$ and simplifying, we have $\\Delta t\\left(1+\\frac{g}{2 c}\\left(t_1+t_2\\right)\\right)=\\tau\\left(1+\\frac{g \\tau}{2 c}\\right) \\approx \\tau$ since $\\tau$ is extremely small, so $\\frac{\\tau}{\\Delta t}=1+\\frac{g}{2 c}\\left(t_1+t_2\\right)$. Since we are working to first order in $g$, we may use $t_1 \\approx t_2 \\approx h / c$ on the right-hand side, so $\\frac{f_{\\text {Alien }}}{f_{\\text {Fred }}}=\\frac{\\tau}{\\Delta t} \\approx 1+\\frac{g h}{c^2}$.By the equivalence principle, this is a derivation of gravitational redshift. The problem can also be solved by thinking in terms of the ordinary Doppler effect. Consider Fred's frame at time $t=0$. In this frame, the alien is also stationary. The light takes a time $h / c$ to reach the alien; at this point the alien has picked up a velocity of $g h / c$. Then using the ordinary Doppler shift formula gives a frequency shift of $1+g h / c^2$ as seen above. This is valid, as all the effects we implicitly ignored were higher order in $g$, but it harder to see this.",

Let $v_2$ be the vertical component of the velocity of the ball immediately after the collision. Since there are no frictional losses, conservation of energy yields $\\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2=\\frac{1}{2} M v_1^2+\\frac{1}{2} m\\left(v_1^2+v_2^2\\right)$. Since the ball rises to a height much higher than the height of the block, the gravitational potential energy is negligible, so we have ignored it. This assumption also means we can ignore the duration of the collision itself in our calculations below. Plugging in our result for $v_1$,$m v_0^2-(M+m)\\left(\\frac{m}{m+M}\\right)^2 v_0^2=m v_2^2 \\Rightarrow v_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{M}{m+M}} v_0$.The time spent by the ball in the air is $t_1=2 v_2 / g$.The distance traveled horizontally by the ball while it is in the air is $x=v_1 t_1=\\frac{2 v_1 v_2}{g}=\\frac{2 v_0^2}{g} \\sqrt{\\frac{m^2 M}{(m+M)^3}}$. The ball then falls back into the block and is ejected horizontally. Since energy and momentum are conserved from before the first collision and after the second, the final horizontal velocity $v_3$ of the ball is given by the result for a perfectly elastic collision, $v_3=v_0 \\frac{m-M}{m+M}$ as can be derived from the conservation laws. Note that $v_3$ is positive for $m>M$. Thus if $\\beta \\leq 1$, the time $t$ is infinite; the ball never returns to its starting position. Assuming that $\\beta>1$, the ball must move a distance $x$ towards its original collision point, where we have neglected the time taken for the collisions themselves.

There is a symmetry between the electric and magnetic fields such that a variation to your answer to part b can be applied to the magnetic field in this part. You will need to change the multiplicative constant to something dimensionally correct and reverse the sign.

That is, we have derived a relativistic effect, second-order in $v / c$, from the first-order field transformations! Why wasn't this derivation used to discover relativity the moment Maxwell's equations were written down? We have implicitly assumed that Maxwell's equations are the same in all reference frames, but historically it was thought they were only valid in one frame, the reference frame of the ether. Assuming that Maxwell's equations are indeed the same in all frames yields an invariant speed, the speed of light, leaving inevitably to all of special relativity.

After the bowling ball collides with the surface, it is traveling upwards at $v_0$ and the golf ball is traveling downwards at $v_0$. The subsequent collision is most easily understood in the reference frame of the bowling ball; in this frame, the golf ball is traveling downwards at $2 v_0$ and the bowling ball is stationary. Since the bowling ball is very massive compared to the golf ball, the golf ball will rebound at the same speed $2 v_0$. Since there is no surface friction, the angle of reflection will be equal to the angle of incidence. Therefore the golf ball will emerge at angle $2 \\alpha$ to the vertical. In the bowling ball's reference frame, the golf ball emerges with horizontal velocity $2 v_0 \\sin 2 \\alpha$ and upward vertical velocity $2 v_0 \\cos 2 \\alpha$. Transforming these back to the original frame of reference, we obtain the initial conditions for the golf ball's projectile motion, $v_x=2 v_0 \\sin 2 \\alpha, \\quad v_y=2 v_0 \\cos 2 \\alpha+v_0$. The time of flight $t$ of the golf ball is given by $t=\\frac{2 v_y}{g}$ and therefore the range is $l=v_x t=\\frac{2 v_x v_y}{g}$. Combining with our previous result, $l=\\frac{2}{g}\\left(2 v_0 \\sin 2 \\alpha\\right)\\left(2 v_0 \\cos 2 \\alpha+v_0\\right)=\\frac{8 v_0^2}{g} \\sin 2 \\alpha\\left(\\cos 2 \\alpha+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$. For convenience we set $\\beta=2 \\alpha$. Inserting the expression for $v_0$, $l=16 h \\sin \\beta\\left(\\cos \\beta+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\Rightarrow \\frac{d l}{d \\beta}=16 h\\left[\\cos \\beta\\left(\\cos \\beta+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)-\\sin ^2 \\beta\\right]$. Setting this to zero to find the maximum, $\\cos ^2 \\beta-\\sin ^2 \\beta+\\frac{1}{2} \\cos \\beta=0$. This can be rewritten as a quadratic in $\\cos \\beta$, $2 \\cos ^2 \\beta+\\frac{1}{2} \\cos \\beta-1=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\cos \\beta=\\frac{-\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-8}}{4}$. Taking the positive root, $\\cos \\beta=\\frac{\\sqrt{33}-1}{8}=0.593, \\quad \\sin \\beta=\\sqrt{1-\\cos ^2 \\beta}=0.805$. So at maximum, $l=16 h \\cdot 0.805 \\cdot\\left(0.593+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)=14.08 h$ which occurs at $\\cos 2 \\alpha=0.593 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\alpha=0.468=26.8^{\\circ}$.",

        "solution": "We treat the plates as three capacitors in series. Each has an identical capacitance $C$. The figure below then show the three steps.Since $C_2$ is shorted out originally, then effectively there are only two capacitors in series, so the voltage drop across each is $V_0 / 2$, where the a positive potential difference means that the top plate of any given capacitor is positive. The top plate of $C_1$ will then have a positive charge of $q_0=C V_0 / 2$. Note that this means that the bottom plate of the top capacitor will have a negative charge of $-q_0$. Removing the shorting wire across $C_2$ will not change the charges or potential drops across the other two capacitors. Removing the source $V_0$ will also make no difference. Shorting the top plate of $C_1$ with the bottom plate of $C_3$ will make a difference. Positive charge will flow out of top plate of $C_1$ into the bottom plate of $C_3$. Also, negative charge will flow out of the bottom plate of $C_1$ into the top plate of $C_2$. The result is that $C_1$ will acquire a potential difference of $V_1, C_2$ a potential difference of $V_2$, and $C_3$ a potential difference of $V_3$. Let the final charge on the top plate of each capacitoralso be labeled as $q_1, q_2$, and $q_3$. The last figure implies that $V_1+V_2+V_3=0$. By symmetry, we have $V_1=V_3$. So $2 V_1=-V_2$. By charge conservation between the bottom plate of $C_1$ and the top plate of $C_2$ we have $-q_0=-q_1+q_2$. But $q=C V$, so $-\\frac{1}{2} V_0=-V_1+V_2$. Combining the above we get $\\begin{aligned} -\\frac{1}{2} V_0 & =\\frac{1}{2} V_2+V_2 \\ -\\frac{1}{3} V_0 & =V_2 \\end{aligned}$.Finally, solving for $V_1$, we get $V_1=V_0 / 6$. Alternatively, we could focus on the plate arrangement and the fact that across a boundary $\\left|\\Delta E_{\\perp}\\right|=$ $\\left|\\sigma / \\epsilon_0\\right|$, a consequence of Gauss's Law. Also, we have, for parallel plate configurations, $|\\Delta V|=|E d|$. Since $\\epsilon_0$ and $d$ are the same for each of the three regions, it is sufficient to simply look at the electric fields. In the first picture we require that $2 E_0=V_0 / d$. The charge density on the second plate requires that $\\Delta E=E_0$. In the last picture we have $2 E_1+E_2=0$, since the potential between the top plate and the bottom plate is zero. But we also have, on the second plate, $\\Delta E=E_1-E_2$. Combining, $E_0=-\\frac{1}{2} E_2-E_2=-\\frac{3}{2} E_2$, and therefore $V_2=-\\frac{1}{3} V_0$, and $V_1=V_0 / 6$.",

Since the process is adiabatic, $Q$ = 0, so$W_2 = \\Delta E = nC_V\\DeltaT = \\frac{3nR(T_2 + T_1)}{3} = 3.64 * 10^-9J$ where we used the fact that$C_V = 3R/2$ for a monatomic gas. There is no work done during the isochoric process, so the total workdone on the bubble is $W = 3.4 * 10^-9J$.Since the process is cyclic, this energy must have been radiated away by the bubble, in a flash of light.Note that the final (positive) sign is important. Some textbooks define $dW$ to be the work done $on$ thebubble, while some define it to be the work done $by$ the bubble. Depending on the conventionsused, there may be some extra signs in intermediate steps, but the final answer doesn't depend on theconvention.",

Because $z_0$ is small, $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta \\approx \\tan \\theta=\\frac{d z}{d r}=2 k r$ and $\\cos \\theta \\approx 1$. Moreover, since $z_0$ is small, the centripetal acceleration is negligible, so we can consider only the tangential acceleration. Since the force tangential to the bowl is $m g \\sin \\theta$, this is $a=g \\sin \\theta$. The radial acceleration $a_r$ is $a_r=-a \\cos \\theta=-g \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta$. Then in the small- $z$ approximation, $a_r \\approx-g \\tan \\theta=-2 k r g$.This is simple harmonic motion with $\\omega=\\sqrt{2 k g}$ and hence period $T=\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{2 k g}}$. The energy-based approach begins with the total energy $E=\\frac{1}{2} m v^2+m g z $. The velocity $v$ is given by$v^2=\\left(\\frac{d r}{d t}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{d z}{d t}\\right)^2$ Because $z$ is small, $\\frac{d z}{d t} \\ll \\frac{d r}{d t}$, and we conclude that $E=\\frac{1}{2} m\\left(\\frac{d r}{d t}\\right)^2+m g k r^2$. By conservation of energy, $0=\\frac{d E}{d t}=m \\frac{d r}{d t} \\frac{d^2 r}{d t^2}+2 m g k r \\frac{d r}{d t}$ which impliesthat $0=\\frac{d^2 r}{d t^2}+2 k r g$, which is the same equation as before.",

By shining a laser beam onto an assembly of neutral atoms, we are able to capture and cool these atoms. When atoms are cooled to near absolute zero temperature, they reveal the whole fascinating quantum behavior, in particular their Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC).\nIn this problem you will study basic concepts of an optical trap of neutral atoms and one of the signatures to recognize the BEC in experiments on sodium atoms.\nAn neutral sodium atom can be well described as a core with positive charge $e$ surrounded by a homogenous electron cloud with negative charge $-e$. The mass of the core is much larger than the mass of the electron cloud. In the absence of an external electric field, the core and the cloud centers coincide. The electric field of a laser beam interacts with the positive core as well as the electron cloud of the atom, so an electric dipole is induced. In turn, this induced dipole will interact with the electric field of the laser beam and thereby gives rise to a dipole potential energy of the atom. The atom is said to feel an optical potential. The later depends on the intensity profile $I(\\vec{r})$ as well as the frequency of the laser beam in use. By choosing an appropriate laser intensity and frequency, one may form a trap-like potential well to confine the neutral atoms.\nWe start off by considering the polarization of a neutral atom that is placed in a uniform external electric field $\\vec{E}_0=E_0 \\hat{u}$, where $\\hat{u}$ is a unit vector and $E_0$ is the field magnitude. Then, a dipole moment $\\vec{p}_0=e \\ell \\widehat{u}=$ $\\alpha E_0 \\hat{u}$ is induced. Here, $\\ell$ is distance between the negative and positive charge centers, and $\\alpha$ is called polarizability. Initially the external field is turned off. Then the field magnitude is increased from zero to $E_0$ very slowly so that the electric field can be considered effectively time-independent in this question. The instantaneous value of the external field is denoted by $\\vec{E}=E \\hat{u}$. ###img_1###: Electron cloud distribution.

In nature, there are two kinds of particles: bosons with integer spin and fermions with half integer spin. Two identical fermions cannot exist in the same quantum state. In contrast, multiple bosons are not forbidden to occupy one quantum state: at ultralow temperatures a large fraction of bosons can condensate into the state with lowest possible energy and form a condensate cloud (condensate bosons), while the rest bosons are in the excited state with higher energy (noncondensate or thermal bosons).

The laser beam has the wavelength $\\lambda$ corresponding to the frequency $\\omega$ (with $\\omega<\\omega_0$ ).

Recall that at ultralow temperatures, the sodium atom cloud consists of condensate atoms and thermal atoms. Condensate bosons behave according to the uncertainty principle that can be used for estimating the spatial size or the momentum distribution of the cloud. On the other hand, thermal bosons are described by classical physics, in particular, they obey the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution law.\nWe estimate the size of the condensate cloud, that is, the mean distance of the condensate sodium atoms from the trap center. Moving inside this cloud, each condensate atom has potential energy as well as kinetic energy. The potential energy is a monotonically increasing function of the cloud size, and the particle tries to reduce it to reach the lowest energy level. On the other hand, as the cloud size decreases, the uncertainty principle requires an increase in the particle momentum, that results in an increase of kinetic energy. The particle therefore finds an optimal cloud size to balance the two opposite tendencies of the two different energy contributions.",

However, this method of space travel is not so efficient. A space elevator, if it could be built, would provide a completely new technology for space travel (###img_1###). This is a long structure that is anchored at the equator and reaches a higher altitude than geostationary orbit (GEO). Geostationary orbit is a circular orbit positioned approximately $42300 \\mathrm{~km}$ from the Earth's center and having a period of the same duration and direction as the rotation of the Earth. An object in this orbit will appear stationary relative to the rotating Earth. The modern ideas of the space elevator were first proposed by Artsutanov (Artsutanov, Y. et al., Science, 158, 946, 1967). However, only modest attention was paid to the subject until Pearson published an inspiring paper \"The Orbital Tower: a Spacecraft Launcher Using the Earth's Rotational Energy\" (Pearson J., Acta Astronautica. Vol. 2, p. 785, 1975). In Pearson's paper, many useful features of the space elevator were pointed out and it was made clear that for the space elevator to ever become a reality, the use of a material that is much stronger but much lighter than steel would be necessary. Due to the lack of such a material, there was little continuation of this research for many years, until the 1990s when carbon nanotubes, a new material composed of hexagonal arrays of carbon atoms, were discovered. In 2003, the Port project (http://www.port.com/) was launched to build and operate a space elevator with current technology. In this part we will study two designs of a space elevator, mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, and explore some applications of space elevator. You are given the mass of Earth $M=5.98 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{~kg}$ \uff0c radius of the Earth $R=6370 \\mathrm{~km}$, geostationary orbit radius $R_G=42300 \\mathrm{~km}$, solar mass $M_S=2 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{~kg}$ , orbital radius of the Earth around the Sun $R_E=1.5 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~km}=1 \\mathrm{AU}$ (AU - the astronomical unit), the orbital speed of the Earth $30.9 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$, and the speed of rotation of the Earth around its axis $\\omega=7.27 \\times 10^{-5}$ $\\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$. Let us first consider a space elevator, which is a cylindrical wire with a uniform cross section $A$ and is homogeneous with density $\\rho$. It is a cylinder positioned vertically at the equator. Its height is greater than the height of the geostationary satellite orbit, so that the stress (force per unit area) on the bottom of the cylinder is zero. The cylinder is in tension along its entire length, with the stress adjusting itself so that each element of the cylinder is in equilibrium under the action of the gravitational, centrifugal, and tension forces.  Calculate the height of the upper end of the cylinder above the Earth's surface",

        "problem": "Carbon nanotubes are materials that meet such requirements because of strong chemical bondings between very light atoms. Two natural polymorphs of carbon are diamond and graphite. In diamond every carbon atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbor (NN) atoms to form a tetrahedron. Graphite has a layer structure. In each layer, carbon atoms are arranged in a hexagonal plane lattice with three NNs. Although diamond is known as the hardest materials, covalent bondings between carbon atoms in hexagonal layers of graphite is stronger than those between carbon atoms in diamond tetrahedra. Graphite is much softer than diamond because of the van der Waals bonding between carbon atoms of different layers, which is much weaker than covalent bonding. A monatomic layer in graphite is called graphene and has monoatomic thickness. Isolated graphene sheet is not stable and has a tendency to roll up to form carbon spheres or carbon nanotubes. The hexagonal crystal lattice of graphene is depicted in ###img_3###. The distance between two NN carbon atoms is $a=0.142 \\mathrm{~nm}$ and the distance between two closest parallel bondings is $b=0.246 \\mathrm{~nm}$. Because the covalent bondings between carbon atoms in graphene are very strong, mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are very special. They have an extremely large Young's modulus and tensile strength, as well as a very light density. Young's modulus is defined as the ratio of the stress along an axis to the strain (ratio of deformation over initial length) along that axis in the range of stress in which Hooke's law holds. Now we examine some mechanical properties of a carbon nanotube having 27 carbon-carbon bondings parallel to the tube axis (for an illustration, see ###img_7###). The bonding between two carbon atoms can be described by the Morse potential $V(x)=V_0\\left(e^{-4 \\frac{x}{a}}-2 e^{-2 \\frac{x}{a}}\\right)$. Here $a=0.142 \\mathrm{~nm}$ is the equilibrium distance between two NN carbon atoms, $V_0=4.93 \\mathrm{eV}$ is the bonding energy, and $x$ is the displacement of the atom from the equilibrium position. Hereafter, we approximate the Morse potential by a quadratic potential $V(x)=P+Q x^2$. All non-nearest-neighbor interactions are neglected. In this approximation, one can propose that carbon atoms are bonded through \"springs\" with the spring constant $k$. Changes in angles between bonds are neglected.###img_1###: Graphite structure ###img_2###: Graphene (a) and carbon nanotube (b). ###img_3###: Graphene. ###img_4###: An illustration of a carbon nanotube with 9 carbon-carbon parallel bondings.

        "problem": "Thermoelectric effects in conducting materials are due to the interplay between heat current and electrical current. In this problem we consider only three predominant thermoelectric effects, namely the Joule, the Seebeck and the Peltier effects, neglecting the others.\nThe Joule effect is a consequence of the interaction between electrical carriers and crystal lattice. Moving directionally in presence of electrical current, carriers transfer a part of their energy to the vibrating crystal lattice, and as a result the crystal is heated. The Joule effect is irreversible.\nThe Seebeck effect can be observed in a thermocouple consisting of two dissimilar conducting bars A and $B$ connecting by direct junction (###img_1###) or junction via an intermediate material C (###img_2###). The material $C$ is good electrical conductor with very small specific heat. When the two junctions of the thermocouple are maintained at different temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ (###img_1### ###img_2###) the Seebeck electromotive force (emf) is produced\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\alpha\\left(T_1-T_2\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the Seebeck coefficient of the thermocouple. $\\alpha$ is considered temperature independent . The Seebeck effect is applied in thermoelectric generator to convert heat energy into electrical one. ###img_1###: direct junctions. Whenever current passes through a thermocouple circuit consisted of two dissimilar conductors $A$ and $B$ with direct junctions (###img_3###) or junctioned via intermediate conductor C (###img_4###), depending on the current direction, heat is either absorbed or released at the junctions of the two conductors.

The Seebeck and Peltier effects are reversible effects in contrast to the irreversible Joule effect. Although the Seebeck and Peltier effects need junctions between the thermoelements, they are essentially bulk effects. A closed electrical cycle in a thermocouple with the Peltier effect (###img_4###) can be used as a refrigerator when heat is removed from one isolated junction and rejected at the other.\nFor simplicity, the heat radiation, circulation, conduction through surrounding environment are considered negligible, and heat current is supposed to be inside the thermocouple and at the heat source and the heat sink.

Note that a vibration mode is not a particle, but a simple oscillation configuration of the entire chain. This vibration mode is analogous to the photon and is called a phonon.

In the experiments, they measured the noise in the charge current across a narrow constriction, the so-called quantum point contact (QPC).

        "problem": "The following questions are designed to guide you to find the answer one step by one step. Background information of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field. It is well known that the Earth has a substantial magnetic field. The field lines defining the structure of the Earth's magnetic field is similar to that of a simple bar magnet, as shown in ###img_1###. The Earth's magnetic field is disturbed by the solar wind, whichis a high-speed stream of hot plasma. (The plasma is the quasi-neutralionized gas.)The plasma blows outward from the Sun and varies in intensity with the amount of surface activity on the Sun. The solar wind compresses the Earth's magnetic field. On the other hand, the Earth's magnetic field shields the Earth from much of the solar wind. When the solar wind encounters the Earth's magnetic field, it is deflected like water around the bow of a ship, as illustrated in ###img_2###. The curved surface at which the solar wind is first deflected is called the bow shock. The corresponding region behind the bow shock andfront of the Earth's magnetic field is called themagnetosheath. The region surroundedby the solar wind is called the magnetosphere.The Earth's magnetic field largely prevents the solar wind from enteringthe magnetosphere. The contact region between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field is named the magnetopause. The location of the magnetopause is mainly determined by the intensity and the magnetic field direction of the solar wind. When the magnetic field in the solar wind is antiparallel to the Earth's magnetic field, magnetic reconnection as shown in ###img_3### takes place at the dayside magnetopause, which allows some charged particles ofthe solar wind in the region \"A\" to move into the magnetotail \"P\" on the night side as illustrated in ###img_4###. A powerful solar wind can push the dayside magnetopause tovery close to the Earth, which could cause a high-orbit satellite (such as a geosynchronous satellite) to be fully exposed to the solar wind. The energetic particles in the solar wind could damage high-tech electronic components in a satellite.Therefore, it isimportant to study the motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, which will give an answer of the aurora generation and could help us to understand the mechanism of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field.

        "problem": "The tea ceremony is traditional in Asia. One of the important steps in preparation of tea is the boiling of fresh water when bubbles appear inside. Bubbles are familiar from daily life and occupy an important role in physics, chemistry, medicine and technology. Nevertheless, their behavior is often surprising and unexpected - and, in many cases, still not understood.\n\nAt room temperature the pure water is saturated with gas. With increasing temperature the excess pressure of dissolved gas $P_{a b}$ increases, the dissolved air is liberated and air bubbles (ABs) appear at the bottom and walls of teakettle (###img_2###). For pure water the wettability is sufficient and an $\\mathrm{AB}$ represents a truncated sphere with radius $R_{a b}$ and with unwetted foundation with radius $r_{a b} \\ll<R_{a b}$. At more heating ABs expand and by reaching certain sizes can detach from the bottom (###img_3###), flow up to the water surface and burst there. The vapor bubbles (VBs) appear when the water temperature at the bottom reaches the critical value $T_w^0 \\approx T_{\\text {crit }}^0=100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ at which the pressure of the saturated vapor exceeds the external pressure. The vapor production increases tens times, VBs expand and detach from the bottom. VB may be considered consisting only of vapor. If the water is heated sufficiently, the uprising VB continue to swell, reach the surface and burst. Else, water is not heated enough in the higher layers and there exits a vertical strong temperature gradient. By reaching relatively cold layers of water VB collapse in the volume of water (###img_4###). This causes the induced degassing - strong oscillations and a considerable amount of dissolved air is released in the form of microscopic air bubbles (MAB). This can generate ultrasonic vibrations. The main stages of the bubble evolution during the boiling process are:\n- the appearance and growth of $\\mathrm{AB}$ at the bottom and walls, their transmutation into $\\mathrm{VB}$;\n- the detachment and uprising of VB, their disappearance in the water volume or at the surface;\n- the appearance of MAB in the water volume and their uprising to the surface.\n\nThis theoretical description is in good agreement with modern experiments. Particularly, an interesting noise analysis experiment (NAE, Ural State University, Ekaterinburg) for the boiling water was performed. Highly sensitive microphones attached to wide-band amplifiers and brought to an electric teakettle have detected three main origins of noises:1. AB's detachments from the bottom before boiling (generate oscillations with $v_1 \\sim 100 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, );\n2. VB's collapses in the volume of water (generate oscillations with $v_2 \\sim 1 \\mathrm{kHz}$ );\n3. MAB's appearances under the water surface (generate oscillations with $v_3 \\sim 35 \\mathrm{kHz}$ to $60 \\mathrm{kHz}$ ). Hints:\n1) It is well known that a small bubble rises along a rectilinear path and a laminar flow is observed - water flows easy and layer-wise (see ###img_1### ###img_2###). Then, the Stokes formula describes the dissipative force for a particle moving with slow velocity $v_{\\text {lam }}$ :\n$$\nF_A=6 \\pi \\eta_w R_b v_{\\text {lam }}\n$$\n\nIn contrast to this picture, when relatively large bubbles lift to the surface, it disturbs the surrounding water, cavitation hollows appear behind and the turbulent flow is observed (see ###img_1### ###img_2###). In this case a part of the kinetic energy of an uprising bubble transfers into the dissipative work. 2) When the surface of liquid has a convex (concave) form there appears a surface tension force due to molecular interaction near the edge. This pressure can be given by formula\n$$\n\\Delta P=\\frac{2 \\sigma}{R}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$-is the surface tension coefficient (unit=N/m), the force coming to unit length of surface, $R$ - is the radius of surface curvity.\n3) When dealing with a short process with characteristic duration time \" $t$ \", its inverse value may be considered as a characteristic frequency $v=\\frac{1}{t}$.

        "problem": "Atoms of many chemical elements possess very low ionization energy and easily loose the outer electrons. Vice versa, atoms of other elements accept easily the electrons. Taken into one volume, these positive and negative ions can combine into stable ionic structures. Many solids exhibit a crystal structure, in which the atoms are arranged in extremely regular, periodic patterns. In an ideal crystal the same basic structural unit is repeated through the space. The main contribution to the binding energy of an ionic crystal is given by the electrostatic potential energy of ions.\n\nThe electric interaction acting between two point charges $\\mathrm{q}_1$ and $\\mathrm{q}_2$ standing in distance $\\mathrm{R}$ is well defined by Coulomb's potential:\n$$\nV_C(R)=k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{R}\n$$\nwhere $k=1 / 4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\approx 9 \\cdot 10^9\\left[N \\cdot m^2 / C^2\\right]$ is the Coulomb constant. A negative force implies an attractive force. The force is directed along the line joining the two charges. For the case of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ crystals both types of ions has the unit charge $\\pm \\mathbf{e}$ and one should also take into account many other neighbors acting on the chosen ion. Taking into account all positive and negative ions in a crystal of the infinite sizes results in the attractive potential energy $V_{a t t}(r)=\\alpha \\cdot V_C(r)$, where $r$ is the distance between nearest neighbors and $\\alpha=1.74756$ is the Madelung constant [E.Madelung, Phys. Zs, 19 (1918) p542] and used in determining the energy of a single ion in a crystal.\n\nAlong the attractive potential energy there should to be a repulsive potential energy due to the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the overlap of electron shells in a crystal lattice. In contrast to the Coulomb-type attractive part, the repulsive potential energy is very short range. There are two different models to describe the repulsive potential.\nModel \\#1. A reasonable approximation to the repulsive potential is an exponential function:\n$$\nV_{r e p 1}(r)=\\lambda \\cdot e^{-r / \\rho}, \\quad(\\lambda, \\rho>0)\n$$\nwhich describes the repulsion interaction of selected ion with the entire crystal lattice. Here $\\lambda$ is coupling strength and $\\rho$ stands for the range parameter.\n\nModel \\#2. Another good approximation to the repulsive potential is an inverse power\n$$\nV_{\\text {rep } 2}(r)=b / r^n, \\quad(b>0)\n$$\nwhere $b$ is coupling strength and $n$ is integer greater than 2 (the Born exponent). These parameters take into account the repulsion with entire crystals.\n\nObviously, the physical parameters and model potentials depend on the type of crystal lattice.\nExperimental data for the lattice constant $r_0$ and the dissociation energy $\\mathrm{E}_{d i s}$ (needed to break the lattice into separate ions) are given in Table 1 for some ionic crystals at normal temperature and pressure. \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|}\n\\hline Crystal & $r_0[\\mathrm{~nm}]$ & $\\mathrm{E}_{\\text {dis }}[\\mathrm{kJ} /$ mole $]$ \\\\\n\\hline $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ & 0.282 & +764.4 \\\\\n\\hline $\\mathrm{LiF}$ & 0.214 & +1014.0 \\\\\n\\hline $\\mathrm{RbBr}$ & 0.345 & +638.8 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} Table 1: Properties of Salt Crystals with the $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ Structure [C.Kittel, \"Introduction to Solid State Physics\", N.Y., Wiley (1976) p.92] (in one mole there are the Avogadro's number of pairs of ions or atoms).

Points of the phase space are called imaging points. Every imaging point determines some state of the system.\n\nWhen the mechanical system evolves, the corresponding imaging point follows a trajectory in the phase space which is called phase trajectory. One puts an arrow along the phase trajectory to show direction of the evolution. A set of all possible phase trajectories of a given mechanical system is called a phase portrait of the system. Analysis of this phase portrait allows one to unravel important qualitative properties of dynamics of the system, without solving equations of motion of the system in an explicit form. In many cases, the use of the phase space is the most appropriate method to solve problems in mechanics.\n\nIn this problem, we suggest you to use phase space in analyzing some mechanical systems with one degree of freedom, i.e., systems which are described by only one coordinate. In this case, the phase space is a two-dimensional plane. The phase trajectory is a curve on this plane given by a dependence of the momentum on the coordinate of the point, or vice versa, by a dependence of the coordinate of the point on the momentum.\n\nAs an example we present a phase trajectory of a free particle moving along $x$ axis in positive direction (###img_1###: Phase trajectory of a free particle.).

Modern strong resistive electromagnets can provide steady magnetic fields higher than 30 tesla. Their coils are typically built by stacking hundreds of thin circular plates made of copper sheet metal with lots of cooling holes stamped in them; there are also insulators with the same pattern. When voltage is applied across the coil, current flows through the plates along a helical path to generate high magnetic fields in the center of the magnet.\n\nIn this question we aim to assess if a cylindrical coil (or solenoid) of many turns can serve as a magnet for generating high magnetic fields. As shown in ###img_1###, the center of the magnet is at 0 . Its cylindrical coil consists of $N$ turns of copper wire carrying a current $I$ uniformly distributed over the cross section of the wire. The coil's mean diameter is $D$ and its length along the axial direction $x$ is $\\ell$. The wire's cross section is rectangular with width $a$ and height $b$. The turns of the coil are so tightly wound that the plane of each turn may be taken as perpendicular to the $x$ axis and $\\ell=N a$.

In assessing if such a magnet can serve to provide high magnetic fields, two limiting factors must not be overlooked. One is the mechanical rigidity of the coil to withstand large Lorentz force on the field-producing current. The other is that the enormous amount of Joule heat generated in the wire must not cause excessive temperature rise. We shall examine these two factors using simplified models.\n\nThe Appendix at the end of the question lists some mathematical formulae and physical data which may be used if necessary.

For example, following a large expansion, it can collapse rapidly to a small radius and, near the end of the collapse, emit light almost instantly. In this phenomenon, called single-bubble sonoluminescence, the gas bubble undergoes cyclic motions which typically consist of three stages: expansion, collapse, and multiple after-bounces. In the following we shall focus mainly on the collapsing stage.\n\nWe assume that, at all times, the bubble considered is spherical and its center remains stationary in the liquid. See ###img_1###. The pressure, temperature, and density are always uniform inside the bubble as its size diminishes. The liquid containing the bubble is assumed to be isotropic, nonviscous, incompressible, and very much larger in extent than the bubble. All effects due to gravity and surface tension are neglected so that pressures on both sides of the bubble-liquid interface are always equal.\n- Radial motion of the bubble-liquid interface\n\nAs the bubble's radius $R=R(t)$ changes with time $t$, the bubble-liquid interface will move with radial velocity $\\dot{R} \\equiv d R / d t$. It follows from the equation of continuity of incompressible fluids that the liquid's radial velocity $\\dot{r} \\equiv d r / d t$ at distance $r$ from the center of the bubble is related to the rate of change of the bubble's volume $V$ by $$\n\\frac{d V}{d t}=4 \\pi R^2 \\dot{R}=4 \\pi r^2 \\dot{r}\n$$\n\nThis implies that the total kinetic energy $E_{\\mathrm{k}}$ of the liquid with mass density $\\rho_0$ is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{k}}=\\frac{1}{2} \\int_R^{r_0} \\rho_0\\left(4 \\pi r^2 d r\\right) \\dot{r}^2=2 \\pi \\rho_0 R^4 \\dot{R}^2 \\int_R^{r_0} \\frac{1}{r^2} d r=2 \\pi \\rho_0 R^4 \\dot{R}^2\\left(\\frac{1}{R}-\\frac{1}{r_0}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $r_0$ is the radius of the outer surface of the liquid. Assume the ambient pressure $P_0$ acting on the outer surface $r=r_0$ of the liquid is constant.\nLet $P=P(R)$ be the gas pressure when the radius of the bubble is $R$.\nFind the amount of work $d W$ done on the liquid when the radius of the bubble changes from $R$ to $R+d R$. Use $P_0$ and $P$ to express $d W$. The work $d W$ must be equal to the corresponding change in the total kinetic energy of the liquid.

A typical door hangs on two or three such hinges, but its weight is concentrated on only one of them - this is the hinge that will creak. The cylinder of that hinge presses down on its metal base with the weight of the entire door, whose mass is $M$. The cylinder is not a perfectly rigid body - it can twist tangentially without changing its overall form, so that vertical line segments become tilted with a small angle $\\alpha$; see ###img_2###. The elastic force on a small area element $d S$ of the base due to this deformation is given by:\n$$\nd F=G \\alpha d S\n$$\nwhere $G$ is a material property known as the shear modulus. Use the values $r=5 \\mathrm{~mm}, h=3 \\mathrm{~cm}, \\Delta r=1 \\mathrm{~mm}$, $\\mu_s=0.75, \\mu_k=0.55, G=8 \\cdot 10^{10} \\mathrm{~Pa}, M=30 \\mathrm{~kg}, g=9.8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2$.

For conventional materials like water or glass, which are usually optically transparent, both of their $\\varepsilon_r$ and $\\mu_r$ are positive, and refraction phenomenon meeting Snell's law occurs when light from air strikes obliquely on the surface of such kind of substances. In 1964, a Russia scientist V. Veselago rigorously proved that a material with simultaneously negative $\\varepsilon_r$ and $\\mu_r$ would exhibit many amazing and even unbelievable optical properties. In early 21 st century, such unusual optical materials were successfully demonstrated in some laboratories. Nowadays study on such unusual optical materials has become a frontier scientific research field. Through solving several problems in what follows, you can gain some basic understanding of the fundamental optical properties of such unusual materials. It should be noticed that a material with simultaneously negative $\\varepsilon_r$ and $\\mu_r$ possesses the following important property. When a light wave propagates forward inside such a medium for a distance $\\Delta$, the phase of the light wave will decrease, rather than increase an amount of $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r \\mu_r} k \\Delta$ as what happens in a conventional medium with simultaneously positive $\\varepsilon_r$ and $\\mu_r$. Here, positive root is always taken when we apply the square-root calculation, while $k$ is the wave vector of the light. In the questions listed below, we assume that both the relative permittivity and permeability of air are equal to 1. According to the property described above, assuming that a light beam strikes from air on the surface of such an unusual material with relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_r<0$ and relative permeability $\\mu_r<0$, prove that the direction of the refracted light beam depicted in ###img_1### is reasonable.",

The ring is moving with certain angular acceleration $\\alpha$. Thus, our reference system is not an inertial one and there exists certain linear acceleration in it. The radial component of this acceleration may be neglected as the ring is very thin and no radial effects should be observed in it. The tangential component of the linear acceleration along the considered part of the ring is $\\mathrm{r} \\alpha$. When we speak about the reference system in which the positive ions forming the crystal lattice of the metal are at rest. In this system certain inertial force acts on the electrons. This inertial force has the value $m r \\alpha$ and its oriented in a opposite side to the acceleration mentioned above.\n\nAn interaction between the electrons and crystal lattice does not allow electrons to increase their velocity without any limitations. This interaction, according to the Ohm's law, is increasing when the velocity of electrons with respect to the crystal lattice in increasing. At some moment equilibrium between the inertial force and the breaking force due the interaction with the lattice is reached. The net results is that the positive ions and the negative electrons are moving with different velocities; its means that in the system in which the ions are at rest an electric current will flow!\n\nThe inertial force is constant and in each point is tangent to the ring. It's acts onto the electrons in the same way as certain fictitious electric field tangent to the ring in each point.\n\nNow we shall find value of this fictitious electric field. Of course, the force due to it should be equal to the inertial force. Thus:\n$$\ne E=m r \\alpha\n$$\n\nTherefore: $$\nE=\\frac{m r \\alpha}{e}\n$$\n\nIn the ring 9 at rest) with resistance $R$, the field of the above value would generate a current:\n$$\nI=\\frac{2 \\pi r E}{R}\n$$ Thus, the current in the considered ring should be :\n$$\nI=\\frac{2 \\pi m r^2 \\alpha}{R}\n$$\n\nIt is true that the field $\\mathrm{E}$ is a fictitious electric field. But it describes a real action of the inertial force onto electrons. The current flowing in the ring is real! .\n\nThe above considerations allow us to treat the system described in the system described in the text of the problem as a very long solenoid consisting of $n$ loops per unit of length (along the symmetry axis), in which the current I is flowing. It is well known that the magnitude of the field B inside such solenoid (far from its end) is homogenous and its value is equal:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& B=\\mu_0 \\eta I \\\\\n& \\mathrm{~B}=\\mu \\mu_0 \\eta I\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ denotes the permeability of vacuum.

Moreover, it seems that due to this problem it is easier to understand why the electrical term: electromotive force\" contains a mechanical term \"force\" inside.",

A triangular plate is denoted by a pair of indices $(m, n)$, where $m, n=0,1,2$, $\\cdots, N-1$ representing the order in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively. $\\mathrm{A}(m, n), \\mathrm{B}(m, n)$ and $\\mathrm{C}(m, n)$ denote the positions of the 3 vertices of the triangle $(m, n)$. The top-left vertex, $\\mathrm{A}(0$, $0)$ (the big black circle), is fixed.\n\nThe motion of the whole system is confined in the $x-y$ plane. The moment of inertia of a uniform equilateral triangular plate about its center of mass is $I=M l^2 / 12$. The free fall acceleration is $g$. Please use $E_{\\mathrm{k}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ to denote kinetic energy and potential energy respectively.

The expansion of space indicates that, when the universe expands, the distance between objects in our universe also expands. It is convenient to use \"comoving\" coordinate system $\\vec{r}=(x, y, z)$ to label points in our expanding universe, in which the coordinate distance $\\Delta r=\\left|\\vec{r}_2-\\vec{r}_1\\right|=\\sqrt{\\left(x_2-x_1\\right)^2+\\left(y_2-y_1\\right)^2+\\left(z_2-z_1\\right)^2}$ between objects 1 and 2 does not change. (Here we assume no peculiar motion, i.e. no additional motion of those objects other than the motion following the expansion of the universe.) The situation is illustrated in the ###img_1### below (the figure has two space dimensions, but our universe actually has three space dimensions). The modern theory of cosmology is built upon Einstein's general relativity. However, under proper assumptions, a simplified understanding under the framework of Newton's theory of gravity is also possible. In the following questions, we shall work in the framework of Newton's gravity.\n\nTo measure the physical distance, a \"scale factor\" $a(t)$ is introduced such that the physical distance $\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{p}}$ between the comoving points $\\vec{r}_1$ and $\\vec{r}_2$ is\n$$\n\\Delta r_{\\mathrm{p}}=a(t) \\Delta r\n$$\n\nThe expansion of the universe implies that $a(t)$ is an increasing function of time. On large scales - scales much larger than galaxies and their clusters - our universe is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. So let us consider a toy model of our universe, which is filled with uniformly distributed particles. There are so many particles, such that we model them as a continuous fluid. Furthermore, we assume the number of particles is conserved.\n\nCurrently, our universe is dominated by non-relativistic matter, whose kinetic energy is negligible compared to its mass energy. Let $\\rho_{\\mathrm{m}}(t)$ be the physical energy density (i.e. energyper unit physical volume, which is dominated by mass energy for non-relativistic matter and the gravitational potential energy is not counted as part of the \"physical energy density\") of non-relativistic matter at time $t$.

Due to Coulomb interactions, electrons in vacuum are repulsive to each other. However, in some metals, the net force between electrons can become attractive due to the lattice vibrations. When the temperature of the metal is low enough, lower than some critical temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$, electrons with opposite momenta and opposite spins can form pairs called Cooper pairs. By forming Cooper pairs, each electron reduces its energy by $\\Delta$ compared to a freely propagating electron in the metal which has energy $\\frac{p^2}{2 m_{\\mathrm{e}}}$, where $p$ is the momentum and $m_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the mass of an electron. The Cooper pairs can flow without resistance and the metal becomes a superconductor.\n\nHowever, even at temperatures lower than $T_c$, superconductivity can be destroyed if the superconductor is under the influence of an external magnetic field. In this problem, you are going to work out how Cooper pairs can be destroyed by external magnetic fields through two effects. The first is called the paramagnetic effect, in which all the electrons can lower their energy by aligning the electron magnetic moments parallel to the magnetic field instead of forming Cooper pairs with opposite spins.\n\nThe second is called the diamagnetic effect, in which increasing the magnetic field will change the orbital motion of the Cooper pairs and increase their energy. When the applied magnetic field is stronger than a critical value $B_{\\mathrm{c}}$, this increase in energy becomes higher than $2 \\Delta$. As a result, the electrons do not prefer forming Cooper pairs.\n\nRecently, a type of superconductor called Ising superconductors was discovered. These superconductors can survive even when the applied magnetic field is as strong as 60 Tesla, comparable to the largest magnetic fields which can be created in laboratories. You will work out why Ising superconductors can overcome both the paramagnetic and the diamagnetic effects of the magnetic fields. Let us consider a ring with radius $r$, charge $-e$ and mass $m$.

The filament itself can not be properly described by the macroscopic theory and apparent singularities (infinities) are insignificant. Real physical quantities, such as the energy, of the region inside a thin tube of radius $a$ around the filament should be neglected. Outside of this tube the density of superflow kinetic energy $\\rho v^2 / 2$ (where $\\rho=$ const) is analogous to the energy density of the magnetic field $B^2 /\\left(2 \\mu_0\\right)$ - they are both quadratic in respective variables. This analogy together with the correspondence between magnetic field and superfluid velocity generated by vortices (currents) facilitates calculation of the flow energy for a given system.

Gravitational waves are the space-time ripples propagating with the speed of light similarly to electromagnetic waves. Direct detection of gravitational waves is incredibly difficult, however, the first signal was detected on September 14, 2015, by LIGO and VIRGO collaborations.\nGravitational waves are emitted during the rapid motion of massive objects. The most powerful source of gravitational waves is the merging of two Supermassive Black Holes (SBH). Black holes predicted by Theory of General Relativity represent extremely compact objects which might have very large masses. Other specific properties of black holes will not be needed in the solution of this problem.\nIn the generally accepted theory of galaxies' evolution, it is supposed that there is SBH with the mass ranging from $10^5-10^9$ of Solar masses in the galaxy's center. Galaxies are huge stellar systems containing $10^{10}-10^{11}$ stars. During their evolution, two galaxies can collide and merge into one. What happens to two SBHs initially located in their centers? The evolution of the SBH binary system can be divided into three main stages. At each stage SBHs approach each other, although the underlying physical phenomena differ. We will examine these phenomena separately in the first three parts of the problem. In the fourth part, we will use the obtained relations to calculate the total time of the SBH binary system evolution.\nAt the end of their evolution, two SBHs will eventually approach each other and merge into a single black hole. The merging process lasts about an hour and is accompanied by an intense burst of gravitational radiation. Future observatories like LISA will be able to detect this gravitational radiation. Still, the research on the $\\mathrm{SBH}$ evolution is under way now, at the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy. 1. Express all your numerical answers in parsecs (pc) for the distances and giga-years (Gy) for the time intervals. We will use Solar mass $\\left(M_S\\right)$ as a reference mass. You might need these values:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 1 \\mathrm{pc}=3.1 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~m}, \\\\\n& M_s=2.0 \\times 10^{30} \\mathrm{~kg}, \\\\\n& t_H=13.7 \\mathrm{~Gy}, \\text { age of the Universe, } \\\\\n& G=6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~N} \\times \\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{kg}^2, \\\\\n& c=3.0 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n2. When you encounter the word \"estimate\", you are not demanded the exact answer. It is sufficient to obtain a result that differs from the accurate one, not more than by a factor of 10 . On the contrary, when you encounter the word \"find\", you are supposed to achieve the exact answer. The word \"calculate\" asks you to bring the numerical answer.\n3. Throughout the problem, assume every star in the galaxy to have the same mass $m=M_S$.\n4. Throughout the problem we will not take into account the effects of the Theory of General Relativity except gravitational waves emission. All stars and black holes are considered as point masses governed by Newton's gravitation law. In this part we shall study the simplified model of the galaxy. You can ignore the velocities of the stars in the galaxy and assume the constant stellar concentration $n$. The characteristic size of the galaxy is $R$. The stellar concentration is small enough, so the stellar collisions are extemely rare and negligible. Let us consider a SBH with the mass $M \\gg m$ moving with the velocity $v$ through the galaxy. Surprisingly, the SBH experiences nonzero average force from the stars. This force slows the motion of the SBH and is called the force of dynamical friction for this reason. This part is devoted to the determination of this force. Let us work in the SBH's reference frame and consider the transit of one star with impact parameter $b$ (###img_1###).

The objects that do not serve any particular purpose are called space debris. The most attention is usually paid to the larger debris objects, i.e. defunct satellites and spent rocket upper stages, which stay in orbit after delivering their payload. Collisions of such objects with each other may result in thousands of fragments endangering all current space missions.\nThere is a well-known hypothetical scenario, according to which certain collisions may cause a cascade where each subsequent collision generates more space debris that increase the likelihood of new collisions. Such a chain reaction, resulting in the loss of all near-Earth satellites and making impossible further space programs, is called the Kessler syndrome.\nTo prevent such undesirable outcome special missions are planned to remove large debris object from their present orbits either by tugging them to the Earth's atmosphere or to graveyard orbits. To this end a specially designed spacecraft - a space tug - must capture a debris object. However, before capturing an uncontrolled object it is important to understand its rotational dynamics.\nWe suggest you to take part in planning of such a mission and find out how the rotational dynamics of a debris object changes in time under the influence of different factors. The debris object to be considered is a \"Kerbodyne 42 \" rocket upper stage, whose schematic is shown in ###img_1###. The circle line in ###img_1### marks the outline of a spherical fuel tank. We introduce a body-fixed reference frame $C x y$ with the origin in the center of mass $C, x$ being the symmetry axis of the stage, and $y$ perpendicular to $x$. The inertia moments with respect to $x$ and $y$ axes are $J_x$ and $J_y\\left(J_x<J_y\\right)$. Consider an arbitrary initial rotation of the stage with angular momentum $L$ (###img_2###), where $\\theta$ is the angle between the symmetry axis and the direction of angular momentum. Fuel tank at this point is assumed to be empty. No forces or torques act upon the stage.

The equality of these two periods presumably came about because of actions of tidal forces over the long history of the Earth-Moon system.\n\nHowever, the period of rotation of the Earth about its axis is currently shorter than the period of revolution of the Moon. As a result, lunar tidal forces continue to act in a way that tends to slow down the rotational speed of the Earth and drive the Moon itself further away from the Earth.\n\nIn this question, we are interested in obtaining an estimate of how much more time it will take for the rotational period of the Earth to become equal to the period of revolution of the Moon. The Moon will then become a synchronous satellite, appearing as a fixed object in the sky and visible only to those observers on the side of the Earth facing the Moon. We also want to find out how long it will take for the Earth to complete one rotation when the said two periods are equal.\n\nTwo right-handed rectangular coordinate systems are adopted as reference frames. The third coordinate axes of these two systems are parallel to each other and normal to the orbital plane of the Moon. (I) The first frame, called the $C M$ frame, is an inertial frame with its origin located at the center of mass $C$ of the Earth-Moon system. (II) The second frame, called the $x y z$ frame, has its origin fixed at the center $O$ of the Earth. Its $z$-axis coincides with the axis of rotation of the Earth. Its $x$-axis is along the line connecting the centers of the Moon and the Earth, and points in the direction of the unit vector $\\hat{r}$ as shown in ###img_1###. The Moon remains always on the negative $x$-axis in this frame.\nNote that distances in ###img_1### are not drawn to scale. The curved arrows show the directions of the Earth's rotation and the Moon's revolution. The Earth-Moon distance is denoted by $r$. The following data are given:\n(a) At present, the distance between the Moon and the Earth is $r_0=3.85 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m}$ and increases at a rate of $0.038 \\mathrm{~m}$ per year.\n(b) The period of revolution of the Moon is currently $T_M=27.322$ days.\n(c) The mass of the Moon is $M=7.35 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\n(d) The radius of the Moon is $R_M=1.74 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n(e) The period of rotation of the Earth is currently $T_E=23.933$ hours.\n(f) The mass of the Earth is $M_E=5.97 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{~kg}$.\n(g) The radius of the Earth is $R_E=6.37 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n(h) The universal gravitational constant is $G=6.67259 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2 / \\mathrm{kg}^2$.\n\nThe following assumptions may be made when answering questions:\n(i) The Earth-Moon system is isolated from the rest of the universe.\n(ii) The orbit of the Moon about the Earth is circular.\n(iii) The axis of rotation of the Earth is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the Moon.\n(iv) If the Moon is absent and the Earth does not rotate, then the mass distribution of the Earth is spherically symmetric and the radius of the Earth is $R_E$.\n(v) For the Earth or the Moon, the moment of inertia $I$ about any axis passing through its center is that of a uniform sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$, i.e. $I=\\frac{2}{5} M R^2$.\n(vi) The water around the Earth is stationary in the $x y z$ frame. With respect to the center of mass $C$, what is the current value of the total angular momentum $L$ of the Earth-Moon system?",

The total momentum of the system conserves, therefore the center-of-mass (CM) of the system moves with a constant velocity: $ v_{\\mathrm{CM}}=\\frac{m v}{3 m}=\\frac{v}{3} $ along $Y$. In what follows, we will work in the CM frame of reference, which is an inertial system of reference. Therefore, in the CM frame the laws of conservation of energy, momentum, and the angular momentum hold true. The initial velocities of the three balls along $Y$ are: $ v_A=\\frac{2 v}{3} ; v_B=v_C=-\\frac{v}{3} . $  Correspondingly, the total kinetic energy of the balls is: $ E=\\frac{m v^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{4}{9}+\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{9}\\right)=\\frac{m v^2}{3} $ and the total angular momentum with respect to the CM equals: $ L=m \\frac{2 v}{3} \\ell-m \\frac{v}{3}(-\\ell)=m v \\ell $  In any moment the three balls form an isosceles triangle with an angle $2 \\varphi$ at the top vertex. The distance between $A$ and $C$ is minimal when either $\\varphi=0$, or $\\dot{\\varphi}=0$. For $\\varphi=0$, however, the laws of conservation are not consistent with the rigidity of the rods.

Although, $I$ could be found using the distances from the balls to the CM (medicentre of a triangle), it is more convenient to use this relatively unknown formula for the moment of inertia of a collection of point masses with respect to CM: $ I=\\frac{\\sum_{i, j} m_i m_j\\left(\\boldsymbol{r}_i-\\boldsymbol{r}_j\\right)^2}{\\sum_i m_i} . $  In our case: $ I=\\frac{m^2}{3 m}\\left(A B^2+B C^2+A C^2\\right)=\\frac{m}{3}\\left(2 \\ell^2+d^2\\right) . $  From (1) and (2), we obtain the minimal distance: $ d=\\ell \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}} \\approx 1.58 \\ell $",

        "solution": "Magnetic field gives rise to magnetization of water molecules, i.e. each of the molecules becomes a magnetic dipole. Inhomogeneous magnetic field exerts a force to a magnetic dipole. Water molecules being diamagnetic are pushed away from the region of stronger magnetic field. Water reaches a state with mechanical equilibrium where the magnetic force is balanced by a force due to pressure gradient. Hence, in mechanical equilibrium, regions with stronger magnetic field correspond to smaller pressures. When the current in the solenoid is increased, the pressure differences grow, and at a certain moment, a region will appear where the pressure is smaller than the saturation pressure of the water vapour. This is the moment when water starts boiling.  To begin with, let us discuss possible reasonable approximations. First, we can neglect the water column pressure which is only 2 to 4 percents of the atmospheric pressure. Second, the saturation pressure of water vapour under normal conditions is also much smaller than the atmospheric one and therefore can be neglected. Thus we can say that boiling starts when the pressure drop due to magnetic field becomes equal to $p_0$.  So, we need to relate the pressure difference caused by the magnetic field to the magnetic field strength. Notice that if a region with magnetic field $B$ is filled with water, the magnetic field energy density is $B^2 /\\left(2 \\mu_r \\mu_0\\right)$; meanwhile, if there is no water, the energy density is $B^2 /\\left(2 \\mu_0\\right)$. So, we can ascribe the energy density difference $ \\Delta w=\\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_r}-1\\right) $ to the interaction of water and magnetic field. Next, consider the following thought experiment. We push away a small volume $V$ of water from the neighbourhood of a point $P$ in the water where the magnetic field strength is $B$; the displaced water fills in a narrow layer at the top of the water surface of equal volume. Assuming that the magnetic field is negligibly small at the top, by comparing the initial and final states, we conclude that the total interaction energy is reduced by $\\Delta w V$. When pushing away water from $P$ we perform mechanical work $p V$, where $p$ is the pressure at point $P$. At the upper surface of the water, the moving interface performs mechanical work $p_0 V$ so that the net mechanical work performed by water during this process is $\\left(p_0-p\\right) V$. Due to energy conservation law, $\\Delta w V=\\left(p_0-p\\right) V$ so that: $ p_0=p+\\frac{B^2}{2 \\mu_0}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_r}-1\\right) . $  Note that the way how we derived this relationship is completely analogous to how the Bernoulli law is derived, and in fact, the obtained equality can be interpreted as a modified Bernoulli law for zero speed where the volume density of potential energy in gravity field $\\rho g h$ is replaced with $\\Delta w$ - the energy density of magnetic interaction. This equality can be simplified by noting that $\\frac{1}{\\mu_r}-1=-\\chi / \\mu_r \\approx-\\chi$ so that: $ p_0=p-\\frac{\\chi B^2}{2 \\mu_0} $ As discussed above, the boiling condition is $p \\approx 0$, hence: $ B=\\sqrt{\\frac{-2 \\mu_0 p_0}{\\chi}} . $  Finally, we apply the formula for magnetic field strength inside a long solenoid $B=\\mu_0 I \\frac{N}{\\ell}$ to find: $ I=\\frac{\\ell}{N} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 p_0}{-\\chi \\mu_0}}=4.4 \\mathrm{kA} $",

Let $A$ and $B$ be the suspension point and the free end of the rope respectively, and $N$ be the node on the rope for the second natural vibration (see the figure).

It originates from multiplying the flux $j_0 \\propto v_{x 0}$ and momentum that one molecule transfers $p_0=2 m v_{x 0}$ (elastic collision), where $v_{x 0}$ is the normal component of molecule's velocity, and taking the average $\\left(\\overline{2 v_{x 0}^2} \\propto T_0\\right)$. When applying the same idea to the surface with good thermal contact, we find out that the flux remains the same, although the momentum increases: $ p_1=m\\left(v_{x 0}+v_{x 1}\\right) \\approx m v_{x 1}, $ where $v_{x 1}$ is the normal velocity component of the molecule flying away from the disk. Thus for pressure $P_1$ : $ \\frac{P_1}{P_0}=\\frac{\\overline{v_{x 0} v_{x 1}}}{\\overline{2 v_{x 0}^2}} \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{T_1 T_0}}{T_0}, $ which is correct to some numerical coefficient of the order of one.

After the velocity $v$ of the disc becomes on the order of $v_0=\\sqrt{k_B T_0 / m}$, the flux of molecules reaching the backside $j(v)$ decays faster than exponentially due to the nature of the molecular velocity distribution in the ideal gas (for example, $j\\left(2 v_0\\right) \\approx 10^{-3} j_0$ and $j\\left(3 v_0\\right) \\approx 10^{-6} j_0$ ). That leads to a proportional decrease in a propelling pressure $P_1$. In order to compensate for an initial bias $\\sqrt{T_1 / T_0} \\approx 30$, it will take around a factor of one on the velocity of the disk. Therefore the maximum velocity of the disk: $ v_{\\max } \\approx v_0=\\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_0}{m}} . $  Here we assumed that the disk will not cool close to $T_0$ before it reaches the maximum velocity. Let us show it.

The initial thermal power of heat removal can be estimated as: $ P_{t h} \\approx S j_0 \\times k_B T_1 \\approx S n k_B \\sqrt{T_0 T_1} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_1}{m}} $ and the total heat $Q \\approx N k_B T_1$.

        "solution": "The most important physics to consider is that the magnetic flux through the superconducting mesh is effectively locally locked in place. Consider this effect before anything else. Once the mesh is cooled to the superconducting state the magnetic field as a function of position on the mesh cannot be varied, regardless of the change in location of the dipole. Since the magnetic field is effectively specified along this superconducting plane, the problem reduces to a boundary value problem that is traditionally solved by the method of images.  First, consider what happens if the physical dipole is moved far away from the mesh. An image dipole must be located that fixes the magnetic field to be unchanged. This can be done with an image dipole that is located a distance $a$ behind the mesh, and it must have the same orientation $m$. Now bring back the original dipole, placing it a distance $b$. It is necessary to cancel out the field from this original, but now displaced, dipole with an opposite dipole $-m$ placed behind the mesh at a distance $b$.  Double check your work. If the original dipole is placed at the original location $a$, then there is no need for image charges, and they should cancel out. Indeed, the two image dipoles will, as they have opposite orientations.  The force between the dipole and the image charges must be determined. Though it might be possible to write down these answers quickly, the derivation is shown below.  Consider first that a magnetic dipole moment $m$ can be thought of as a pair of magnetic monopoles of strength $q_m$ and $-q_m$ separated by a distance $d$ such that $m=q_m d$. Determine the magnetic field strength a distance $x \\gg d$ away from the dipole: $ B=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_m}{x^2}+\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\left(-q_m\\right)}{(x+d)^2} $  It should be clear that $q_m$ is at the origin and $-q_m$ is a distance $\\mathrm{d}$ farther away from the reference point $x$ where the field $B$ is being determined. This expression is exact. The second term can be subjected to a binomial expansion and then: $ B \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_m}{x^2}-\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{q_m}{x^2}\\left(1-2 \\frac{d}{x}\\right)=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2 \\pi} \\frac{q_m d}{x^3}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m}{x^3} $  Now consider the magnetic force on a dipole at the location $x$ in a non-uniform field $B$, which is given by: $ F=-q_m B(x)+q_m B(x+d) $ which can be approximated by a Taylor expansion of $B$, $   F \\approx-q_m B(x)+q_m\\left(B(x)+\\left.d \\frac{d B}{d x}\\right|_x\\right) \\\\  F=q_m d\\left(-\\frac{3 \\mu_0}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m}{x^4}\\right)=-\\frac{3 \\mu_0}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m^2}{x^4}  $ The negative sign means that two parallel identical dipoles separated by a distance $x$ will attract. Returning to the problem, the physical dipole at $b$ will be attracted to the image dipole at location $-a$ and repelled from the image dipole at $-b$, so: $ -\\frac{3 \\mu_0}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m^2}{(b+a)^4}+\\frac{3 \\mu_0}{2 \\pi} \\frac{m^2}{(b+b)^4}=\\frac{3 \\mu_0 m^2}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{16 b^4}-\\frac{1}{(a+b)^4}\\right), $ where a negative sign means that the physical dipole feels attraction toward the mesh. It is entertaining to consider what happens if $b$ is almost the same as $a$, say $b=a+\\delta$. In this case, $ F=\\frac{3 \\mu_0 m^2}{2 \\pi}\\left(\\frac{1}{16(a+\\delta)^4}-\\frac{1}{(2 a+\\delta)^4}\\right) $ or $ F \\approx \\frac{3 \\mu_0 m^2}{2 \\pi} \\frac{1}{16 a^4}\\left(\\left(1-4 \\frac{\\delta}{a}\\right)-\\left(1-4 \\frac{\\delta / 2}{a}\\right)\\right), $ which simplifies further into: $ F \\approx-\\frac{3 \\mu_0 m^2}{16 \\pi a^5} \\delta $  Now to interpret. A negative force here is a force of attraction toward the mesh. A positive $\\delta$ is moving the physics dipole away from the mesh. As such, the force is a linear restoring force, and slight disturbances to the physical dipole will result in simple harmonic oscillations about the original position.",

On a cosmic scale, the only phenomena occurring in Earth's energy balance are absorption and emission of radiation. One can say that the earth's climate condition depends on delicate balance between the energy that our planet receives for the formidable energy source that is the sun and the energy that Earth radiates into space. Consider that solar constant for the radiation coming from the Sun towards the Earth is $w_s=1370 \\mathrm{~W} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. $A$ body that absorbs electromagnetic radiation reaching the surface, regardless of the wavelength of the radiation and emits electromagnetic radiation according to the temperature of its surface is called a blackbody. A black body emits energy with a specific spectral distribution, depending on its own temperature. Solid smooth lines, in the graph in ###img_1### show the spectral distribution of the emission energy of the Sun, equivalent to a black body.  If $\\varepsilon(T)$ represents the total energy (in the whole spectrum) emitted by unit area of a black body in unit time, and $T$ is the absolute temperature of the black body, then the Stefan - Boltzmann states that $\\varepsilon(T)=\\sigma \\cdot T^4$.

Any photon or object which falls through the event horizon will not be able to exit back out and will eventually hit the central singularity.  It is convenient to describe the spacetime of non-rotating black holes by four coordinates: $t, r, \\theta$ and $\\phi$, with $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$ and $0 \\leq \\phi<2 \\pi$.

        "problem": "Einstein declared that the idea of the Equivalence Principle (1907) was \"the most fortunate thought (die gl\u00fcckichste Gedanken) of my life\". He recalls that \"I was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a sudden a thought occurred to me: if a person falls freely, he will not feel his own weight. I was startled. This simple thought made a deep impression on me. It impelled me toward a theory of gravitation.\"  So, if an observer is in free fall, he can be regarded as an inertial reference frame in which the gravitational field is abolished. Unfortunately, since different observers in space and time would be falling at different rates and/or in different directions, Einstein realized that one will have to use only local reference frames, so that inside each of them the acceleration due to gravity would be constant in both magnitude and direction.  Consequently, consider a point-like observer of negligible but nonzero mass in the vicinity of a massive object of mass $M$. If the massive object's gravitational field is not too strong, and in the absence of other forces, the observer will move along a gravitational field line with an acceleration equal in each point to the gravitational acceleration in that particular point. However, if mass $M$ is sufficiently large, the notion of gravitational field loses meaning and one is forced to work instead with general relativistic concepts. What remains true, however, is that in situations with planar symmetry the elementary spacetime interval can be written as $ d s^2=-c^2\\left(\\mathrm{~d} t^{\\prime}\\right)^2=-f c^2(\\mathrm{~d} t)^2+\\frac{(\\mathrm{d} x)^2}{g}+(\\mathrm{d} y)^2+(\\mathrm{d} z)^2, $ where $\\mathrm{d} t^{\\prime}$ is the infinitesimal time interval measured by the observer's clock. In general $f$ and $g$ are functions of the spacetime coordinates. Thus, the observed elementary displacements $\\mathrm{d} x$ can be regarded as being affected by some local shrinking factor, and the corresponding times $\\mathrm{d} t$ needed to accomplish the said displacements can be considered as being affected by some local stretching factor. So the difficulty arising in General Relativity is the fact that the known expression for $\\mathrm{d} s^2$ (called the Minkowski metric), in which there are no variable factors whatsoever, no longer holds. In what follows, we will address the simplest possible situation and we will try to describe the events in spacetime using other sets of coordinates (or, more correctly, parameters) than the usual ones, with corresponding shrinking/stretching factors. These will lead us to other more suitable expressions for the spacetime metric $\\mathrm{ds} s^2$.  Let us consider a point-like object of rest mass $m_0$, initially $\\left(t=t^{\\prime}=0 \\mathrm{~s}\\right)$ at rest on the $x$-axis in a point $x_0=c^2 / a^{\\prime}$. It now starts \"falling freely\" in the positive direction of the axis, so that at any time the proper acceleration experienced in an inertial reference frame momentarily co-moving with the object is constant, $a^{\\prime}$. Write down the expression of the acceleration of the body in the \"gravitational field\" reference frame, in terms of its \"falling\" velocity $v, a^{\\prime}$ and $c$. Show that the net force acting upon the body is constant.",

It is called a Rindler metric, and it looks analogous to the parameterization of a plane using polar coordinates. As one would probably expect, its factors $f$ and $g$ are not invariant under a Lorentz transformation, but in this most simple case one can always return to the Minkowski metric in order to get a globally invariant metric. However in general it proves to be impossible to have an invariant metric.  You also saw that the Rindler metric cannot cover all spacetime. Even if we could extend it, one can easily see that an accelerating observer could never get information from all spacetime (unlike an inertial observer, whose past lightcone is bound to cover at infinity all spacetime). It is said that the events lying on the frontier of the region of spacetime from which the \"falling\" observer can get information make up the socalled event horizon.
