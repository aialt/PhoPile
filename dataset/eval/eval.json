The left edge of the stack, at $x_H=x_0-\\ell / 2$, is held by an external thermal reservoir at temperature $T_H=T_0+\\tau / 2$, and at the same time, its right edge, at $x_C=x_0+\\ell / 2$, is held at a temperature $T_C=T_0-\\tau / 2$. The plate stack allows a slight longitudinal heat flow to maintain a constant temperature gradient between its edges, such that $T_{\\text {plate }}(x)=T_0-\\frac{x-x_0}{\\ell} \\tau$.To analyze the effect of the thermal contact between the plate stack and the gas on the sound waves in the tube, make the following assumptions: - As in the previous part, all changes to the thermodynamic properties are small compared to the unperturbed values. - The system operates in the fundamental standing-wave mode of the longest possible wavelength. It is only slightly modified by the presence of the plate stack. - The stack is much shorter than the wavelength $\\ell \\ll \\lambda_{\\max }$, and can be positioned far enough from both displacement and pressure nodes, so that the displacement $u(x, t) \\approx u\\left(x_0, t\\right)$ and the pressure $p(x, t) \\approx p\\left(x_0, t\\right)$ may be considered uniform over the entire length of the stack. - We may neglect any edge effects, caused by the parcels moving in and out of the stack. - The temperature difference between the ends of the plate stack, i.e. between the hot and the cold reservoirs, is small compared to the absolute temperature: $\\tau \\ll T_0$. - Heat conduction through the stack, through the gas, and along the tube are all negligible. The only significant sources of heat transfer are convection due to the motion of the gas and conduction between the gas and the stack.Consider a specific parcel of gas in the region of the stack, originally at $x_0=L / 4$. As the parcel moves within the stack, the local temperature of the nearby part of the stack changes as follows:$T_{\\text {env }}(t)=T_0-T_{\\text {st }} \\cos (\\omega t)$. Express $T_{\\mathrm{st}}$ in terms of $a, \\tau$ and $\\ell$.",

        "problem": "This question discusses the generation of microwave radiation in a microwave oven, and its use to heat up food. The microwave radiation is generated in a device called 'magnetron'. Part A concerns the operation of the magnetron, while part B deals with the absorption of microwave radiation in food.A magnetron is a device for the generation of microwave radiation, either in pulses (for radar applications), or continuously (e.g., in a microwave oven). The magnetron has a mode of self-amplifying oscillations. Supplying the magnetron with static (non-alternating) voltage quickly excites this mode. The microwave radiation thus created is transmitted out of the magnetron. A typical microwave oven magnetron consists of a solid copper cylindrical cathode (with radius a) and a surrounding anode (with radius $b$ ). The latter has the shape of a thick cylindrical shell into which cylindrical cavities are drilled. These cavities are known as 'resonators'. One of the resonators is coupled to an antenna which will transmit the microwave energy out; we will ignore the antenna in the following. All internal spaces are in vacuum. We will consider a typical magnetron with eight resonators, as depicted in Figure 1(a). The three-dimensional structure of a single resonator is shown in Figure 1(b). As indicated there, each of the eight cavities behaves as an inductor-capacitor (LC) resonator, with operating frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$. A static uniform magnetic field is applied along the magnetron's longitudinal axis, pointing out of the page in Figure 1(a). In addition, a constant voltage is applied between the anode (positive potential) and the cathode (negative potential). Electrons emitted from the cathode reach the anode and charge it, such that they excite an oscillation mode in which the sign of the charge is opposite between every two adjacent resonators. The oscillation of the cavities amplify these oscillations. The process described above creates an alternating electric field with the aforementioned frequency $f=2.45 \\mathrm{GHz}$ (blue lines in Figure 1(a); the static field is not plotted) in the space between the cathode and the anode, in addition to the static field caused by the applied constant voltage. In the steady state, the typical amplitude of the alternating electric field between the anode and the cathode is approximately $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the static electric field there. The electron motion in the space between the cathode and the anode is affected by both the static and the alternating parts of the field. This causes electrons that reach the anode to transfer about $80 \\%$ of the energy they acquire from the static field into the alternating field. A minority of the ejected electrons returns to the cathode and releases additional electrons, further amplifying the alternating field. Each resonator can be thought of as a capacitor and an inductor, see Figure 1(b). The capacitance mainly arises from the planar parts of the resonator surface, while the inductance stems from the cylindrical part. Assume that the current in the resonator flows uniformly very close to the surface of its cylindrical cavity, and that the strength of the magnetic field generated by this current is 0.6 times that of an ideal infinite solenoid. The various lengths defining the resonator geometry are given in Figure 1(b). The vacuum permittivity and permeability are $\\varepsilon_0=8.85 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\mu_0=4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\frac{\\mathrm{H}}{\\mathrm{m}}$, respectively.Use the above data to estimate the frequency $f_{\\text {est }}$ of a single resonator.

Let's calculate the position of the center of mass at equilibrium of the upper part, i.e., all points with $l^{\\prime}>l$ for some $l>l_0$. From part A, the position of a small portion $\\Delta l^{\\prime}$ with coordinate $l^{\\prime}$ is: $H\\left(l^{\\prime}\\right)=\\frac{l^{\\prime 2}}{2 l_0}+\\frac{l_0}{2}$ and the center of mass of this part is: $\\begin{aligned} H_{\\text {cm-upper }-i}= & \\frac{L_0}{M\\left(L_0-l\\right)} \\int_l^{L_0} H\\left(l^{\\prime}\\right) d m=\\frac{L_0}{M\\left(L_0-l\\right)} \\int_l^{L_0}\\left(\\frac{l^{\\prime 2}}{2 l_0}+\\frac{l_0}{2}\\right) d m \\ & =\\frac{L_0}{M\\left(L_0-l\\right)} \\int_l^{L_0}\\left(\\frac{l^{\\prime 2}}{2 l_0}+\\frac{l_0}{2}\\right) \\frac{M d l^{\\prime}}{L_0}=\\frac{1}{\\left(L_0-l\\right)} \\int_l^{L_0}\\left(\\frac{l^{\\prime 2}}{2 l_0}+\\frac{l_0}{2}\\right) d l^{\\prime} \\ & =\\frac{1}{\\left(L_0-l\\right)}\\left[\\frac{l^{\\prime 3}}{6 l_0}+\\frac{l_0 l^{\\prime}}{2}\\right]_l^{L_{-} 0}=\\frac{L_0^2+L_0 l+l^2}{6 l_0}+\\frac{l_0}{2} \\end{aligned}$. The position of the upper part of $\\mathrm{CM}$ when it contracts to a length $L_0-l$ is $H_{c m-u p p e r-f}=$ $\\frac{l^2}{2 l_0}+\\frac{l_0}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(L_0-l\\right)$. The change in the $\\mathrm{CM}$ during the contraction process is: $\\Delta H_{c m-\\text { upper }}=$ $H_{c m-\\text { upper }-i}-H_{c m \\text {-upper }-f}=\\frac{L_0^2+L_0 l-2 l^2}{6 l_0}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(L_0-l\\right)=\\frac{\\left(L_0-l\\right)\\left(L_0+2 l\\right)}{6 l_0}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(L_0-l\\right)$. The acceleration of the CM of the upper part is $a_{C M}=\\frac{F L_0}{M\\left(L_0-l\\right)}=\\frac{g L_0}{L_0-l}$. From the work energy theorem we get the equation $v_{\\text {upper }-f}^2=2 a_{C M} \\Delta H_{c m-u p p e r}$, hence $\\begin{gathered} v_{\\text {upper }-f}^2=2 \\frac{g L_0}{L_0-l}\\left[\\frac{\\left(L_0-l\\right)\\left(L_0+2 l\\right)}{6 \\alpha L_0}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(L_0-l\\right)\\right]=2 g\\left[\\frac{L_0+2 l}{6 \\alpha}-\\frac{1}{2} L_0\\right] \\ =\\frac{2 g}{3 \\alpha} l+\\left(\\frac{1}{3 \\alpha}-1\\right) g L_0 \\end{gathered}$. Therefore, $A=\\frac{2 g}{3 \\alpha}$ and $B=\\left(\\frac{1}{3 \\alpha}-1\\right) g L_0$. Note that for $l=L_0$, we have $v_{u p p e r-f}^2=L_0 g \\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}$ and for $l=l_0=\\alpha L_0$, we get $v_{u p p e r-f}^2=$ $L_0 g \\frac{1-\\alpha}{3 \\alpha}$, hence, the moment we release the spring its velocity is finite (not zero, the meaning is that it accumulate this velocity in time that is much shorter than the contracting time $t_c$ ) and it decreases to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ of the initial value when $l=l_0$.",

All that is left is the elastic energy stored in the spring, which is converted into heat, sound, etc. To calculate it, we consider the elastic energy stored in a segment $d h$ of the stretched spring, which when unstretched lies between $l$ and $l+\\mathrm{d} l$, using the result of Task A.2, $\\Delta W=$ $\\frac{k L_0}{2 \\Delta l}\\left(\\Delta l_2^2-\\Delta l^2\\right)$, by choosing $\\Delta l=d l$ and $\\Delta l_2=d y$, and using $d y=\\frac{l}{l_0} d l$ (which was obtained in Task A.3), we get: $d W=\\frac{k L_0}{2}\\left(\\frac{l^2}{l_0^2}-1\\right) d l$.

We will use a coordinate system with axes parallel to the cube's edges, with the origin set at the cube's center. Assuming the particle is at coordinates ( $x, y, z) x \\ll a$, $y \\ll a, z \\ll a$, we will find the force $\\vec{F}$ acting on the particle, by splitting the cube $a \\times a \\times a$ into a rectangular cuboid $(a-2 x) \\times(a-2 y) \\times(a-2 z)$ and three square plates of thickness $2 x, 2 y$ and $2 z$.The particle is in the center of the cuboid, so there is no force from the cuboid.

        "solution": "First approach: The Ampere's force acting on a short piece of wire of length $\\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{d}} l$ is) $\\vec{F}_{a m p}=I \\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{d} l} \\times \\vec{B}$. The net force acting on this piece is $\\vec{F}=\\vec{T}_1+\\vec{T}_2+I \\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{d}} l \\times \\vec{B}=0$. Here $\\vec{T}_1$ and $\\vec{T}_2$ are tension force of the wire acting on the two end points of the piece. Projected on the $\\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{d}} l$, this equation reads: $T_1=T_2 \\text {. }$ Therefore, the tension is constant along the wire. Let $\\vec{n}(l)$ be the tangent vector of the wire at the distance $l$ from the point of suspension. The equation (1) reads $\\begin{gathered} \\vec{T}_1+\\vec{T}_2+I \\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{d}} l \\times \\vec{B}=\\mathrm{d} l\\left(T \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\vec{n}(l)}{\\mathrm{d} l}+I \\vec{n}(l) \\times \\vec{B}\\right)=0, \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\vec{n}(l)}{\\mathrm{d} l}=-\\frac{I}{T} \\vec{n}(l) \\times \\vec{B}. \\end{gathered}$ This equation implies that $\\vec{B} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\vec{n}(l)}{\\mathrm{d} l}=0 \\Longrightarrow \\vec{B} \\cdot n(l)=\\text { const. }$.The tangent vector of the wire $\u000bec{n}$ is at constant angle to the magnetic field. In the horizontal plane the tangent vector is rotating at a constant speed. Thus, each side of the loop has the cylindrical helix shape, i. e. it is winding around some cylinder and making the constant angle $\\alpha$ to the magnetic field. To find the radius of this cylinder, let's write the equation in the projection on the horizontal plane: $\\begin{gathered} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\vec{n}_{x y}}{\\mathrm{~d} l_{x y}} \\sin (\\alpha)=-\\frac{I}{T} \\vec{n}_{x y} \\times \\vec{B} . \\ R=\\frac{T}{I B} \\sin (\\alpha) . \\end{gathered}$. At the point of the weight suspension we have the balance between three forces: two forces of tension (from each side of the loop) and the gravitational force of the weight, which is vertical. These three forces should be in the same vertical plane. Therefore, both sides of the loop are winding around the same cylinder. Each half of the loop should make a half-turn around this cylinder. Thus, the length of the half of the loop is $L=\\sqrt{H^2+(\\pi R)^2}$. Therefore, $R=\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\sqrt{L^2-H^2}=\\frac{1}{\\pi} L \\sin (\\alpha)$. The tension force of the wire can be found from equations (2) and (3) $T=\\frac{I B R}{\\sin (\\alpha)}=\\frac{I B L}{\\pi}$.The suspended weight is $\\begin{gathered} P=2 T \\cos (\\alpha)=2 T \\frac{H}{L} . \\ P=\\frac{2 I B H}{\\pi} . \\end{gathered}$ Second approach:Stable equilibrium corresponds to a minimum of potential energy. The potential energy is a sum of the gravitational energy of the weight and of the energy of the loop in the magnetic field. Let $S$ be an area of the loop projected on the horizontal plane. $E_{\\mathrm{p}}=-P H-I S B$. $E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ depends on two variable parameters: $H$ and $S$. Note that we can change the form of the projection (not changing its length) of the loop onto horizontal plane without changing $H$. Thus, the minimum of the potential energy corresponds to the maximum area of the projection with fixed length \u2014 a circle. Now, if the projection is fixed, the height $H$ is maximal if the wire makes a constant angle with the vertical axis. Thus, the wire has a shape of cylindrical helix - each side is winding a cylinder, while making constant angle $\\alpha$ with vertical axis. Let $R$ be the radius of the cylinder. Then $\\begin{gathered} S=\\pi R^2=\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left(L^2-H^2\\right) . \\ E_{\\mathrm{p}}=-P H-I B \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\left(L^2-H^2\\right) . \\end{gathered}$. The condition for the minimum of the potential energy is $\\begin{gathered} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial H}=0 . \\ P=\\frac{2 I B H}{\\pi} . \\end{gathered}$. The force balance equation at the point of weight suspension: $\\begin{gathered} 2 \\frac{H}{L} T=P . \\ T=\\frac{L I B}{\\pi} . \\end{gathered}$.",

Find the magnitude of the ball accelerations at this moment and express your answer in terms of $q, B, m, v, R$, and $z_{\\max }$. The equations of motion of the centre of mass of balls is: $2 m \\dot{\\vec{v}}_C=q\\left[\\left(\\vec{v}_1+\\vec{v}_2\\right) \\times \\vec{B}\\right]=q\\left[\\vec{v}_C \\times \\vec{B}\\right]$ where $\\vec{v}_C$ is the velocity of the centre of mass, $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$ are velocities of balls. Notice that $v_C=0$ at the start of motion then $v_C$ remains equal to 0 always. The equation for the rotation of the ball about the centre of mass is: $\\frac{d \\vec{L}}{d t}=q[\\vec{R} \\times[\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}]]$. Now let's use the formula of a triple vector product: $[\\vec{R} \\times[\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}]]=\\vec{v}(\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{B})-\\vec{B}(\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v})$. So balls move around the sphere with the center in the middle of rod. It means that $\\vec{R} \\perp \\vec{v}$ then $\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{v}=0$. Hence $\\frac{d \\vec{L}}{d t}=q \\vec{v}(\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{B})$. Firstly, $\\vec{B}$ directs along $z$-axis, then $(\\vec{R} \\cdot \\vec{B})=B z$, where $z$ is a coordinat of the ball. Secondly, let look at projection of vector equation onto $z$-axis:$\\frac{d L_z}{d t}=q v_z B z=q B z \\frac{d z}{d t}$.Multiplying to $d t$ and integrating gives us this equation: $L_z=\\frac{q B z^2}{2}+C$, where $C=0$ because $L_z=0$ at the start of the motion when $z=0$. When $z$ is maximum $v_z=\\dot{z}=0$. It means, that $L=L_z=m u r$, where $r$ is a distance between the ball and $z$-axis, $u$ is the velocity of the ball at this moment. Recall that the ball is moving around the sphere then $r^2+z^2=R^2$. The Lorenz force and the contact ball-rod force don't do the work. It means the kinetic energy of the system is constant. Together with $\\vec{v}_C=0$, it gives that velocities of the balls don't change i.e. $u=v$. To summarize, $L_z=m v \\sqrt{R^2-z_{\\max }^2}$. Let's combine the results of the two last blocks as a biquadratic equation for $z_{\\max }$ : $\\left(\\frac{q B}{2 m v}\\right)^2 z_{\\max }^4+z_{\\max }^2-R^2=0$. Solution is: $z_{\\max }=\\frac{\\sqrt{2} m v}{q B} \\sqrt{\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{q B R}{m v}\\right)^2}-1}$. This result can be obtained in a faster way by those who are familiar with the generalized momentum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, $\\overrightarrow{\\mathcal{P}}=m \\vec{v}+q \\vec{A}$ where $\\vec{A}$ is the vector potential which is defined by the condition curl $\\vec{A}=\\vec{B}$. We can choose $\\vec{A}=\\frac{1}{2} \\hat{\\tau} B r$, where $r$ denotes the distance from the $z$-axis, and $\\hat{\\tau}$ stands for the unit vector perpendicular both to the radius vector and to the $z$-axis. This is a vector field obeving cylindrical symmetry around the $z$-axis and because of that, the corresponding generalized momentum is conserved, $\\mathcal{L}_z=\\vec{R} \\times \\overrightarrow{\\mathcal{P}} \\cdot \\hat{z}=m r v_{\\perp}+\\frac{1}{2} q B r^2 \\equiv \\frac{1}{2} q B R^2;$ here $v_{\\perp}$ denotes the velocity component perpendicular to the $z$-axis. Noting that at the topmost position of the ball's trajectory, $v_{\\perp}=v$ due to the fact that the speed is constant and horizontal (i.e. in $x-y$-plane), we obtain a quadratic equation for $\\rho=\\frac{r}{R}$ :$\\rho^2+2 \\kappa \\rho-1=0, \\quad \\kappa \\equiv \\frac{m v}{q B R}$. We select the positive root $\\rho=\\sqrt{\\kappa^2+1}-\\kappa$. Now we can write the final answer as $z_{\\max }=R \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}=R \\kappa \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\kappa^{-2}+1}-1}$ which coincides with the previous result. Consider three orthogonal unit vectors: 1-st is along with the velocity, 2-nd along with direction from ball to the middle of the rod, and 3-rd is perpendicular to the other two. As we found earlier that $v=$ const, so $a_1=0$. Further, $a_2$ coinsides with $v^2 / R$ because ball is moving around sphere. Finally, the projection of 2-nd Newton law onto the 3rd axis is: $m a_3=q v B \\frac{z_{\\max }}{R}$. Hence $a=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{v^2}{R}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{q v B z_{\\max }}{m R}\\right)^2}$.",

Laser radiation is generated when a large number of atoms transferred to an excited state by external action (pumping) emit photons with the same phase and polarization. A consistent theory of laser radiation is based on quantum mechanics but some aspects of this phenomenon can be understood by means of classical electrodynamics. Let us first consider emission of a photon by a single atom. According to classical electrodynamics, an atom can be regarded as dipole emitter. In this model an electric dipole is associated with an atom comprised of an immobile atomic nucleus with a positive charge $+q$ and a negative charge $-q$ oscillating harmonically around it (the negative charge is located at the center of the charge distribution of electron cloud). Here the atomic dipole moment oscillates according to the law $\\vec{p}(t)=\\vec{p}_m \\cos (\\omega t+\\varphi)$. The cyclic oscillation frequency is related to the energy of emitted photons by the Planck relation $E_\\gamma=\\hbar \\omega$. Hereinafter the frequency of photons means cyclic frequency.

A pulse duration $\\Delta t$ and a dispersion of frequency of pulse oscillations $\\Delta \\omega$ (spectral width) are related by the inequality $\\Delta \\omega \\Delta t \\geq 2 \\pi$. Laser pulses generated in the superradiance mode already have the shortest possible duration for the given dispersion of frequencies, $\\Delta t_0 \\approx \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\Delta \\omega_0}$. Therefore, the pulse duration can be reduced in two steps: first, increase the spectral width of the pulse (without changing the duration) and second, compress the pulse in time. One of the most common ways to solve the first problem is pulse chirping. This method is based on the use of nonlinearity of a medium, i.e. dependence of the refractive index of the medium $n$ on the amplitude of oscillations of the electric field $E_m$ of the wave. The dependence is of the form $n=n_0+n_2 E_m^2$, where $n_0$ and $n_2$ are some constants specific for the medium. Nonlinear effects are small, e.g. in quartz at a light intensity $I_1=10^9 \\mathrm{~W} / \\mathrm{cm}^2$ the refractive index increases only by $n_2 E_{m 1}^2 \\approx 3.2 \\cdot 10^{-7}$. The intensity of an electromagnetic wave in a medium is determined by the formula $I=\\frac{\\varepsilon_0 n_0 c}{2} E_m^2$.

An approximate dependence of the electric field on time in such a pulse is shown in the Figure. The speed of the wave maxima is the same at the pulse edges and in the central part it decreases due to the nonlinearity effects. Because of that the total pulse duration does not change, the frequency increases at the rear part of the pulse and decreases at the front. Such a pulse is called 'chirped'.Let the amplitudes of two wave maxima be $E_{m 1}$ and $E_{m 2}$. Find the difference in their propagation speeds $\\Delta v$.

Let $|\\mathrm{OB}|=r ;|\\mathrm{OC}|=R \\text {. }$ Thus: $|\\mathrm{BC}|^2=R^2+r^2-2 R r \\cos \\phi$. Electrostatic potential created by ring element $\\mathrm{d} \\phi$ at the point $\\mathrm{B}$ : $\\mathrm{d} \\Phi=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{\\lambda R \\mathrm{~d} \\phi}{\\sqrt{R^2+r^2-2 R r \\cos \\phi}}=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0} \\frac{\\lambda \\mathrm{d} \\phi}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{r^2}{R^2}-2 \\frac{r}{R} \\cos \\phi}}$.

From here, comparing with the expression $\\Phi(r)=q\\left(\\alpha+\\beta r^2\\right)$, we obtain$\\beta=\\frac{1}{16 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 R^3}$.(ii) Gauss's law.Let us analyze a small cylinder of radius $r$. The center of the cylinder coincides with the center of the ring. In part A we analyzed the potential along the $z$-axis, while in this part we analyze the potential along the radius $r$. For any $z \\ll R$ and $r \\ll R$ the potential has an expression: $\\Phi(z, r)=\\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 R}\\left(1-\\frac{z^2}{2 R^2}\\right)+q \\beta r^2$. The lowest order terms are quadratic in $r$ and $z$. Due to reflection symmetry the potential does not contain terms of the type $r z$. This, for example, immediately gives us $\\alpha=1 /\\left(4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 R\\right)$. Thus, for small $r$ and $z$ electric fields in the radial and axial directions are: $\\mathcal{E}_z(z, r)=+\\frac{q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 R^3} z, \\quad \\mathcal{E}_r(z, r)=-2 q \\beta r$.

The first integral is: $\\int_{\\text {side }} \\overrightarrow{\\mathcal{E}} \\cdot \\mathrm{d} \\vec{S}=4 \\pi r z \\mathcal{E}_r(z, r)=-8 \\pi q \\beta r^2 z$.Gauss's theorem thus gives: $\\frac{q z r^2}{2 \\varepsilon_0 R^3}-8 \\pi q \\beta r^2 z=0$.

The mantle is composed of rocks that we assume can flow in geological timescales and therefore, in this problem will be treated as a fluid. The thickness of the crust is much smaller than the characteristic length scale in the $x$-direction, hence, the crust behaves as a freely bendable plate. To high accuracy, such a ridge can be modeled as a two-dimensional system, without any variation of variables along the $y$-axis, which is perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 2. Assume that the ridge length $L$ along the $y$-axis is much larger than any other length introduced in this problem. At the centre of the ridge the thickness of the crust is assumed to be zero. As the horizontal distance $x$ from the centre increases, the crust gets thicker and approaches a constant thickness $D$ as $x \\rightarrow \\infty$. Correspondingly, the ocean floor subsides by a vertical height $h$ below the top of the ridge $O$, which we define as the origin of our coordinate system (see Fig. 2). Water density $\\rho_0$ and temperature $T_0$ can be assumed to be constant in space and time. The same can be assumed for mantle density $\\rho_1$ and its temperature $T_1$. The temperature of the crust $T$ is also constant in time but can depend on position.It is known that, to high accuracy, the crustal material expands linearly with temperature $T$. Since water and mantle temperatures are assumed to be constant, it is convenient to use a rescaled version of the thermal expansion coefficient. Then $l(T)=l_1\\left[1-k_l\\left(T_1-T\\right) /\\left(T_1-T_0\\right)\\right]$, where $l$ is the length of a piece of crustal material, $l_1$ is its length at temperature $T_1$, and $k_l$ is the rescaled thermal expansion coefficient, which can be assumed to be constant.Assuming that the crust is isotropic, find how its density $\\rho$ depends on its temperature $T$.

As a result of the earthquake, a uniform flux of the so-called longitudinal $P$ waves is emitted along all the directions in the $x-z$ plane that have positive component along the $z$-axis.

This is a second order differential equation. De- $\\lambda$ pending on the values for $b$ and $c$, the solution might grow exponentially. The standard method for solving this type of equation involves making an educated guess and plugging it into the equation. In this case, an exponential solution of the form $\\delta I=$ $\\delta I_{0} \\exp (\\lambda t)$ will work. Note that this is all equivalent to operating with complex imped ances but with $\\lambda=\\mathrm{i} \\omega$. substituting the ansatz into the differential equation and reducing the prefactors, one gets the characteristic equation: $\\lambda^{2}+b \\lambda+c=0$. This is a quadratic equation with two solutions $\\lambda_{12}=-\\frac{b}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{b^{2}}{4}-c}$, $\\lambda_{12}$ can be either both real or both complex, depending on the sign of the discriminant.

If $\\lambda$ is complex, then $\\lambda_{2}$ and $\\lambda_{1}$ are each-other's complex conjugates and so their product must be positive. Hence, $c>0$ regardless of whether $\\lambda$ is real or complex.                According to Vieta's first formula, $\\lambda_{1}+$ $\\lambda_{2}=-b$. If $\\lambda$ is real, then their sum has to be negative, otherwise at least one of $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$ is positive. Hence, $b>0$. If $\\lambda$ is complex, then their sum is purely real (because they're each-other's complex conjugates) and hence again, the sum has to be negative for the rea parts to be negative. Hence, $b>0$ must always hold.                The $b>0$ and $c>0$ are necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution to be stable.

As such, part of the rotational energy of the plate is transferred over to the escaping air molecules. Further, the pressure and temperature of the gas is uniform, because of the incompressibility condition.  Since the problem is 2-dimensional, the mass, volumes, moment of inertia and other quantities are per unit length of the system (on the figure, into the page). Let $\\boldsymbol{x}$ mark the distance from the bump and $v$ denote the horizontal speed of air at $x$. There is a volume of air equal to $V(x)=x h x /(2 L)$ between $x=0$ and $x$. As the plate falls down, $V(x)$ gets smaller and as a result, air is pushed out. Consider a small time interval $\\mathrm{d} t$.

        "solution": "The incoming water from ' 2 ' will spread out axisymmetrically along the space between the stone disk and the ceiling. After that, it will spread into the basin and eventually leave through the outgoing pipe ' 3 '. The stone disk is kept up by the pressure differences between the top and bottom of the disc, arising from the flow speed of the water differing on either sides. The fact that pressures differ on boths sides can be seen directly by the application of the Bernoulli Principle $p+\\rho_w v^2 / 2=$ const along a streamline or by noting that the flow speed gradients are driven by pressure gradients.  The flow speed outside the gap is negligible due to $t \\ll R$, hence we can take the pressure at the bottom side to be uniformly $p_0$. The flow speed in the gap at a distance $x$ from the axis of symmetry can be found from the conservation of mass applied on a concentric cylinder of radius $x$ and height $t$, giving $2 \\pi x t \\rho_w v(x)=\\mu$. Hence, $ v(x)=\\frac{\\mu}{2 \\pi x t \\rho_w} . $  Applying Bernoulli's principle, we get $p(x)+$ $\\rho_w v^2 / 2=p_0$ and so $ \\Delta p=p_0-p(x)=\\frac{\\rho_w v^2}{2}=\\frac{1}{2 \\rho_w}\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2 \\pi x t}\\right)^2 . $  We can hence find the force due to the pressure differences in the gap by integrating from $x=r$ to $x=R$. First note that the resulting force will be pointing vertically up, because $p(x)<p_0$. Integrating, $  F_1  =\\int_{x=r}^{x=R} 2 \\pi x \\mathrm{~d} x \\Delta p \\\\  =\\frac{\\mu^2}{4 \\pi t^2 \\rho_w} \\int_{x=r}^{x=R} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x}{x} \\\\  =\\frac{\\mu^2}{4 \\pi t^2 \\rho_w} \\ln \\left(\\frac{R}{r}\\right) .  $  Note that the water entering through the pipe will slow down, pushing the disk further down. The net force from this, however, turns out to be negligible due to the condition $r \\gg t$. To see this, one can argue that the said force is of order $\\mu v_{\\text {pipe }} \\sim \\mu \\mu /\\left(\\rho_w r^2\\right) \\sim$ $\\mu^2 /\\left(\\rho_w r^2\\right) \\ll F_1$.

        "solution": "Because the expansion of water is reversible, entropy is conserved. This means that the change in entropy due to the expansion of the vapour is balanced by the entropy change due to condensation. As discussed before, because entropy is a function of state, it's most convenient to calculate the entropy change by imagining $\\boldsymbol{n}$ moles of water ( $\\boldsymbol{n}$ will later cancel out) cooling and expanding from $\\boldsymbol{T}_t, \\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{t}}$ to $\\boldsymbol{T}_{\\boldsymbol{0}}, \\boldsymbol{p}_0$ and condensing $\\boldsymbol{r n}$ moles of water at the end. $r$ is found by demanding that $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{S}=\\mathbf{0}$ in this process.  The entropy change of the vapour is found by applying the first law of thermodynamics over a small temperature and pressure increment $\\mathrm{d} T, \\mathrm{~d} p$ : $ \\mathrm{d} S_{\\text {vapour }}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d} Q}{T}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d} U+\\mathrm{d} W}{T}, $ where $\\mathrm{d} U=n c_v \\mathrm{~d} T$ is the change in internal energy of the vapour and $\\mathrm{d} W=p \\mathrm{~d} V$ is the work done by the vapour. Importantly, we neglect the volume of water compared to the vapour, as that allows using the ideal gas to simplify the work differential. Using the ideal gas law, we then have $ p \\mathrm{~d} V=p \\mathrm{~d}\\left(\\frac{n R T}{p}\\right)=n R \\mathrm{~d} T-n R T \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{p} . $  Hence, $ \\mathrm{d} S_{\\text {vapour }}=n\\left(c_v+R\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d} T}{T}-n R \\frac{\\mathrm{d} p}{p} $ and we can integrate to get $ \\Delta S_{\\text {vapour }}=n c_p \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_0}{T_1}\\right)-n R \\ln \\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_1}\\right) $ where $c_p=c_v+R=R(i+2) / 2=R \\gamma /(\\gamma-1)$ is the heat capacity at constant pressure. The net change in entropy is then $  \\Delta S_{\\text {tot }}=0  =\\Delta S_{\\text {vapour }}+\\Delta S_{\\text {condens }} \\\\  =\\Delta S_{\\text {vapour }}-r n \\frac{M L}{T_0} \\\\  =n c_p \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_0}{T_1}\\right)-n R \\ln \\left(\\frac{p_0}{p_1}\\right)-r n \\frac{M L}{T_0} .  $ Thus, $ r=\\frac{R T_0}{M L}\\left(\\ln \\left(\\frac{p_1}{p_0}\\right)-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} \\ln \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_0}\\right)\\right)=0.114 $  To find the mass flow rate, we start by finding the flow speed $v$ of the outgoing liquid/vapour. Since we know $\\boldsymbol{r}$, we can apply energy conservation (necessary for the reversibility to hold) on a flowing water packet. This is most conveniently done by demanding energy conservation on the system as a whole. Suppose that in some time interval $n$ moles of water vapour with a volume of $V_t$ are created at the boiler. Then at the outlet, in the steady state, due to conservation of particles, $(1-r) n$ moles of water vapour at a volume of $V_0$, alongside $r n$ moles of liquid water, are removed. The outflowing water has an additional kinetic energy of $n \\mu v^2 / \\mathbf{2}$. The energy change of the whole system due to both steps must cancel each-other out due to energy conservation. We can write this as $ 0=W_{\\text {in }}-W_{\\text {out }}+U_{\\text {in }}-U_{\\text {out }}-n M v^2 / 2=0, $ where $W_{\\text {in }}=p_t V_t=n R T_t$ and $W_{\\text {out }}=p_0 V_0=$ $(1-r) n R T_0$ are the works done by the incoming and outgoing packet and similarly, $U_{\\text {in }}=c_v n T_t$ and $U_{\\text {out }}=c_v n T_0-r n M L+r n R T_0$ are the internal energies of the incoming and outgoing packet. Notice that for the outgoing internal energy, we have an extra term of $r p_0 V_0=r n R T_0$. This is because when talking about the latent heat of vaporisation, it includes the work done in order to expand the vapour into the volume it's supposed to occupy. Therefore, we should subtract the said work from the latent heat of vaporisation, in order for it to capture the actual change in the internal energy of the water. Combining everything, we get $  0  =n R T_t-(1-r) n R T_0+c_v n T_t \\\\  -c_v n T_0+r n M L-r n R T_0-n M v^2 / 2 \\\\  =\\left(c_v+R\\right) n\\left(T_t-T_0\\right)+r n M L-n M v^2 / 2  $ and hence, $ v=\\sqrt{2\\left(\\frac{c_p \\Delta T}{M}+r L\\right)}=906 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s} . $  The density of air at the outlet is found from ideal gas law $\\rho=p_0 M /\\left(R T_0\\right)$. The mass flow rate of water vapour is then $ \\mu_{\\mathrm{vapour}}=A \\rho v=\\frac{A p_0 M v}{R T_0}, $ but we also have liquid water flowing out, such that the total flow rate is given by $ \\mu=\\frac{1}{1-r} \\mu_{\\text {vapour }}=\\frac{A p_0 M v}{(1-r) R T_0}=59 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{s} . $",

        "solution": "Since this problem is subtle, we will present multiple solutions. First solution: The motion of the rod can be decomposed as a superposition of rotation about the center of mass, and translation of the center of mass. We claim that the bead is stationary at this moment. To see this, note that the bead cannot have a vertical velocity component since it is fixed to the rod. Moreover, it cannot have a horizontal velocity component, because since the system experiences no external forces in the horizontal direction, the motion of the center of mass has no horizontal component. Therefore, the bead is stationary, and since the released gravitational potential energy is $M g R$, the speed $v$ of the ball obeys $\\frac{1}{2} M v^2=M g R \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v=\\sqrt{2 g R}$. The motion of the system consists of a downward speed $v / 2$ of the center of mass, superposedon a rotation about the center of mass which gives the masses speed $v / 2$. Now consider the forces on the ball. The only horizontal force on the ball is the force in the rod, so we need to find the horizontal acceleration of the ball. Part of this is due to the centripetal force associated with the rotational motion, $F=\\frac{M(v / 2)^2}{R / 2}=M g$. Another part of the ball's acceleration is due to the acceleration of the center of mass, but this is purely vertical and hence irrelevant here. A third part is due to the angular acceleration about the center of mass, but this also is associated with a vertical acceleration of the ball and hence irrelevant. Thus the force in the rod is just a tension $T=M g$. A common pitfall to think of the motion of the system as pure rotation about the bead, giving the incorrect answer $F=M v^2 / R=2 M g$. The reason this is incorrect is that, while it correctly describes the instantaneous velocity, to compute the acceleration one must also account for the acceleration of the instantaneous pivot point, which is not located at the bead for general times. It is possible to do this, but the computation ismuch more involved. Second solution: While the first solution required only two lines of algebra, it also required careful reasoning. Here we present a more complicated, but more straightforward alternative. Let $x$ be the horizontal position of the bead. The position of the ball is $\\mathbf{r}=(x+R \\sin \\theta, R \\cos \\theta)$. By conservation of momentum, the center of mass must be at the same horizontal position as it started, so $2 x+R \\sin \\theta=0$. Therefore, the position of the ball is $\\mathbf{r}=((R / 2) \\sin \\theta, R \\cos \\theta)$. That is, it follows an ellipse whose major axis is twice the minor axis. Differentiating this twice, the acceleration of the ball is $a_x=\\frac{R}{2}\\left(\\alpha \\cos \\theta-\\omega^2 \\sin \\theta\\right), \\quad a_y=-R\\left(\\alpha \\sin \\theta+\\omega^2 \\cos \\theta\\right)$. In this case, $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$ and we are only interested in $a_x$, giving $a_x=-\\frac{R \\omega^2}{2}$. At this point, one needs to find $\\omega(\\theta)$ using conservation of energy. Plugging in the result from either part (c) below or the first solution above gives $a_x=-g$, which indicates a force of $M g$ to the left, and hence a tension in the rod. Incidentally, yet another solution is to use $F=M v^2 / R$ where $R$ is the instantaneous radius of curvature of the ellipse, which may be computed directly. Third solution: We can work in the noninertial reference frame of the bead. In this frame, the ball simply rotates around the bead, with the naive centripetal force $F=\\frac{M v^2}{R}=2 M g$. However, since the tension accelerates the bead to the right, there is a fictitious force of magnitude $T$ pulling the ball to the left in this frame. The real tension force and the fictitious force add up to the centripetal force, so $T+T=F$, giving $T=M g$.",

Work in the frame moving to the right with speed $v$. In this frame the bead is stationary and the ball has velocity $2 v$ and is instantaneously rotating about the bead, so it must be experiencing a centripetal force $\frac{M(2 v)^2}{R}=8 M g$. Unlike in part (a), there are no additional contribution from the acceleration of the rotation center, because the bead can only ever accelerate horizontally, and the force in the rod at this moment is vertical. Since the ball also experiences a downward force of $M g$ due to gravity, the force in the rod is a tension $T=9 M g$. Second solution: We can also solve the problem using the algebraic approach. Following what we found in the second solution to part (a), $a_y=-R\\left(\\alpha \\sin \\theta+\\omega^2 \\cos \\theta\\right)=R \\omega^2$. Plugging in the resultfor $\\omega^2$, one finds $a_y=8 g$ which, as before, indicates a tension of $T=9 \\mathrm{Mg}$. Third solution: Work in the original frame, where the masses are instantaneously rotating about the midpoint of the rod. Because of this motion, the ball must be experiencing a centripetal force $\\frac{M v^2}{R / 2}=4 M g$. This makes answering $5 M g$ a tempting pitfall; to get the right answer, we must also account for the vertical acceleration of the center of mass. The height of the center of mass is $y_{\\mathrm{CM}}=(R / 2) \\cos \\theta$, so $a_{\\mathrm{CM}}=\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(-\\frac{R}{2} \\omega \\sin \\theta\\right)=-\\frac{R}{2}\\left(\\omega^2 \\cos \\theta+\\alpha \\sin \\theta\\right)$.

Therefore, the total upward acceleration of the ball is $8 g$, as we found earlier, so the force in the rod is a tension $T=9 \\mathrm{Mg}$.

These distances are measured in parsecs, where $1 \\mathrm{pc}=3.086 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{~m}$. The speed of the jet flow is assumed to be directed radially away from the central AGN, and be a function of $s$ only. The plasma in the jet is comprised of electrons, protons, and some heavier ionised nuclei. The average energy carried by each particle in the jet, in the reference frame of the bulk flow of the jet (which we will call the jet frame), is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{av}}=\\mu_{\\mathrm{pp}} c^2+h$, where the term $h$ includes all thermal kinetic energy and potential energies in terms of the pressure $P$ and $n$ is the number density of the plasma.\nAs the stars, which the jet flows past, move through their life cycles they can lose part of their atmosphere. This results in a uniform rate of injection of mass per unit volume $\\alpha$ into the jet, and the injected particles are assumed to be at rest relative to the AGN.\nThis model can be applied to the Centaurus A jet. Centaurus A is one of the nearest AGN, so it is possible to observe its jet at relatively high spatial resolution. The total power carried by the jet is estimated to be $P_{\\mathrm{j}}=1 \\times 10^{36} \\mathrm{~J} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. See below for a diagram of a simple geometrical description of the Centaurus A jet, including measurements of some jet parameters. $s_1$ is the coordinate of the start of the jet, and $s_2$ the coordinate of the end of the jet. In Centuarus A the average mass per particle is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{pp}}=0.59 m_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and $h=\\frac{13}{4} P / n$. The pressure in the plasma surrounding the jet is $P(s)=5.7 \\times 10^{-12}\\left(\\frac{s}{s_0}\\right)^{-1.5} \\mathrm{~Pa}$, where $s_0=1 \\mathrm{kpc}$. The jet is described by the following parameters, all of which depend on the distance $s$ from the AGN:\n- the opening radius of the jet $r(s)$ in the AGN frame\n- the cross sectional area of the jet $A(s)$ in the AGN frame\n- the speed of the jet $v(s)$ in the AGN frame\n- the lorentz gamma factor of the jet $\\gamma(s)$ in the AGN frame\n- the number density $n(s)$ in the frame of the jet ###img_2###: The Centaurus A jet, showing the geometry compared to the active galactic nucleus (AGN).

The proper number density is the number density in the frame which is locally co-moving with the jet plasma outflow, which we will call the jet frame.",

However, in the frame of the observer, for an electron moving at an ultra relativistic speed, with $\\gamma \\gg 1$, the radiation is concentrated in a forward cone with $\\theta \\lesssim 1 / \\gamma$ (so the total angle of cone is $2 / \\gamma$ ). As the electron is gyrating around the magnetic field, any observer will only see pulses of radiation as the forward cone sweeps through the line of sight. ###img_1###: The diagram on the left shows the distribution of power in radiation from an electron accelerating up the page in the frame at which the electron in momentarily at rest. The diagram on the right shows the distribution of power in radiation for the same electron in the observer's frame, where most radiation is emitted in the forward cone. In the observers frame, the direction of the electron's acceleration is shown by a vector labelled $\\mathbf{a}$ and the direction of its velocity is shown by a vector labelled $\\mathbf{v}$. Find the duration of a pulse, $\\Delta t$, of synchrotron radiation observed from an electron with lorentz factor $\\gamma$, travelling at an angle $\\phi$ to the magnetic field.",

        "problem": "A Tippe top is a special kind of top that can spontaneously invert once it has been set spinning. One can model a Tippe top as a sphere of radius $R$ that is truncated, with a stem added. It has rotational symmetry about an axis through the stem, which is at angle $\\theta$ from the vertical. As shown in ###img_1###, its centre of mass $C$ is offset from its geometric centre $O$ by $\\alpha R$ along its symmetry axis. The Tippe top makes contact with the surface it rests on at point $A$; we assume this surface is planar, and refer to it as the floor. Given certain geometrical constraints and if spun fast enough initially, the Tippe top will tip so that the stem points increasingly downwards, until it starts to spin on in its stem, and eventually comes to a stop. Let $x y z$ be the rotating reference frame defined such that $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is stationary and upwards, and the top's symmetry axis is within the $x z$-plane. Two views of the Tippe top are shown in ###img_1###: from the side, and from above. As shown in ###img_1###, the top's symmetry axis is aligned with the $x$-axis when viewed from above.\n###img_2### shows the top's motion at several phases after it is started spinning:\n(a) phase I: immediately after it is initially set spinning, with $\\theta \\sim 0$\n(b) phase II: soon after, having tipped to angle $0<\\theta<\\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n(c) phase III: when the stem first touches the floor, with $\\theta>\\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n(d) phase IV: after inversion, when the top is spinning on its stem, with $\\theta \\sim \\pi$\n(e) phase V: in its final state, at rest on its stem $\\theta=\\pi$. Let $X Y Z$ be the inertial frame, where the surface the top is on is wholly in the $X Y$-plane. The frame $x y z$ is defined as above, and reached from $X Y Z$ via rotation around the $Z$ axis by $\\phi$. The transformation from the $X Y Z$ frame to frame $x y z$ is shown in ###img_3###. In particular, $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$. Any rotational motion in 3-dimensional space can be described by the three Euler angles $(\\theta, \\phi, \\psi)$. The transformations between the inertial frame $X Y Z$, the intermediate frame $x y z$, and the top's frame 123 can be understood in terms of these Euler angles.\nIn our description of the Tippe top's motion, the angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ are the standard zenith and azimuthal angles respectively, in spherical polar coordinates. In the $X Y Z$ frame they are defined as follows: $\\theta$ is the angle of the top's symmetry axis from the vertical $Z$-axis, representing how far from vertical its stem is, while $\\phi$ represents the top's angular position about the $Z$-axis, and is defined as the angle between the $X Z$-plane and the plane through points $O, A, C$ (i.e. the vertical projection of the top's symmetry axis).\nThe third Euler angle $\\psi$ describes the rotation of the top about its own symmetry axis, i.e. its 'spin', which has angular velocity $\\psi$.\nThe reference frame of the spinning top is defined as a new rotating frame 123 , which is reached by rotating $x y z$ by $\\theta$ around $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ : 'tilting' the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$-axis down by $\\theta$ to meet the top's symmetry axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{3}}$. The transformation from the $x y z$ frame to the 123 frame is shown in ###img_3###. In particular, $\\hat{\\mathbf{2}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. NOTE: For a reference frame $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}$ rotating in inertial frame $\\mathbf{K}$ with angular velocity $\\omega$, the time derivatives of a vector $\\mathbf{A}$ within both frames $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}$ are related via:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}\\right)_{\\mathbf{K}}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial t}\\right)_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}}+\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times \\mathbf{A}\n$$ The motion that a Tippe top undergoes is complex, involving the time evolution of the three Euler angles, as well the translational velocities (or positions) and the motion of the top's symmetry axis. All of these parameters are coupled. To solve for the motion of a Tippe top, one would use standard tools including Newton's laws to prepare the system of equations, then program a computer to solve them numerically via simulation.\nIn this question, you will perform the first part of this process, investigating the physics of the Tippe top to set up the system of equations.\nFriction between the Tippe top and the surface it is moving on drives the motion of the Tippe top. Assume that the top remains in contact with the floor at point $A$, until such time as the stem contacts the floor. It is in motion at point $A$ with velocity $\\mathbf{v}_A$ relative to the floor. The frictional coefficient $\\mu_k$ between the top and floor is kinetic, with $\\left|\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathbf{f}}\\right|=\\mu_k N$, where $\\mathbf{F}_f=F_{f, x} \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+F_{f, y} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is the frictional force, and $N$ is the magnitude of the normal force. Assume that the top is initially set spinning only, i.e. there is no translational impulse given to the top.\nLet the mass of the Tippe top be $m$. Its moments of inertia are: $I_3$ about the axis of symmetry is, and $I_1=I_2$ about the mutually perpendicular principal axes. Let $\\mathbf{s}$ be the position vector of the centre of mass, and $\\mathbf{a}=\\overrightarrow{C A}$ be the vector from the centre of mass to the point of contact.\nUnless otherwise specified, give your answers in the $x y z$ reference frame for full marks. All torques and angular momentum are considered about the centre of mass $C$, unless otherwise specified. You may give your answers in terms of $N$. Except for part A.8, you need only consider the top where $\\theta<\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, and the stem is not in contact with the floor. Find the total external force $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\text {ext }}$ on the Tippe top. Draw a free body diagram of the top, projected onto each of the $x z$-and $x y$-planes.

Proposed tasks mainly deal with the water-hammer effect arising from both fast and slow closings of a flow-control valve in the pipe.\n\nWe consider only nonviscous liquids and liquid flows which are essentially one-dimensional. All pipes including their valves are assumed to be rigid, but liquids are not always considered to be incompressible.

Taking positive $x$ direction as pointing to the right, the velocity of fluid particles next to the valve changes from $v_0$ to $v_1$ $\\left(v_1 \\leq 0\\right)$. Thus the velocity change is $\\Delta v=v_1-v_0$.\n\nIn a frame moving to left (along $-x$ direction) with speed $c$, i.e., riding on the wave (see ###img_1###), velocity of fluid in the pressure wave is $c+v_1$, while that of the incoming fluid in the steady flow ahead of the wave is $c+v_0$. Let $\\rho_1$ be the density of fluid in the pressure wave. From conservation of mass, i.e., equation of continuity, we have\n$$\n\\rho_0\\left(c+v_0\\right)=\\rho_1\\left(c+v_1\\right)\n$$\nor, by letting $\\Delta \\rho \\equiv \\rho_1-\\rho_0$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho_1}=1-\\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_1}=\\frac{v_0-v_1}{c+v_0}=\\frac{-\\Delta v}{c+v_0}\n$$\n\nMoreover, impulse imparted to the fluid must equal its momentum change.

Otherwise the sign should be positive. Note also that for a compressional wave $\\left(\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{s}}>0\\right)$, the velocity imparted to the fluid particle is in the direction of propagation, while for an extensional wave $\\left(\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{s}}<0\\right)$, the velocity imparted is in the opposite direction of propagation.\nEqs.

        "solution": " Pressure $P(t)$ and flow velocity $v(t)$ just before $t=\\frac{\\tau}{2}=\\frac{L}{c}$ and $t=\\tau$\n\nAns:\nWhen the valve is open, the flow in the pipe is steady with velocity $v_0$ and pressure $P_0$. The sudden closure of the valve causes an excess pressure $\\Delta P_s$ on the fluid element next to the valve, causing it to stop with velocity $v_1=0$. The velocity change is thus $\\Delta v=v_1-v_0=-v_0$. Thus, according to Eq. ($\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{s}}=-\\rho_0 c \\Delta v$), the excess pressure on the fluid is given by\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{s}}=-\\rho_0 c \\Delta v=\\rho_0 c v_0\n$$\n\nAt time $t=\\tau / 2=L / c$, the pressure wave reaches the reservoir. The velocity of fluid in the length of the pipe has all changed to $v(\\tau / 2)=v_1=v_0+\\Delta v=0$ and the fluid pressure is $P(\\tau / 2)=P_1=P_0+\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{s}}=P_0+\\rho_0 c v_0$.\n\nAt the reservoir end of the pipe, fluid pressure reduces to the constant hydrostatic pressure $P_h=P_0+\\rho_0 g h$. Equivalently, we may say that the reservoir acts as a free end for the pressure wave and, in reducing its excess pressure to $P_h$, causes a compression wave to be reflected as an expansion wave. Relative to the hydrostatic pressure $P_h$, the amplitude of the incoming pressure wave is $\\Delta P_{1 \\mathrm{r}}=$ $P_1-P_h$, hence the reflected expansion wave will have an amplitude $\\Delta P_1^{\\prime}=-\\Delta P_{1 \\mathrm{r}}$ and we have\n$$\n\\Delta P_1^{\\prime}=-\\Delta P_{1 \\mathrm{r}}=P_h-P_1=\\left(P_0+\\rho_0 g h\\right)-\\left(P_0+\\rho_0 c v_0\\right)=-\\rho_0 c\\left(v_0-g h / c\\right)\n$$\n(Here we allow the pressure amplitude to have both signs with negative amplitude signifying an expansion wave.) This will cause the fluid at the reservoir end of the pipe to suffer a velocity change (keeping in mind that the direction of propagation is now the same as the $+x$ axis)\n$$\n\\Delta v_{1 \\mathrm{r}}=+\\Delta P_1^{\\prime} /\\left(\\rho_0 c\\right)=-\\left(v_0-g h / c\\right)\n$$\n\nConsequently, its velocity changes to\n$$\nv_{1 \\mathrm{r}}=v_1+\\Delta v_{1 \\mathrm{r}}=0-\\left(v_0-\\frac{g h}{c}\\right)\n$$\n\nAhead of the front of the reflected wave, conditions are unchanged and the particle velocity is still $v_1=0$ and the fluid pressure is still $P_1=P_0+\\Delta P_{\\mathrm{s}}$, but behind the wave front the particle velocity now becomes $v_{1 \\mathrm{r}}=-\\left(v_0-g h / c\\right)$ and the pressure becomes $$\nP_1+\\Delta P_1^{\\prime}=\\left(P_0+\\rho_0 c v_0\\right)-\\rho_0 c\\left(v_0-\\frac{g h}{c}\\right)=P_0+\\rho_0 g h\n$$\n\nTherefore, just moment before $t=\\tau=2 L / c$ when the front of the reflected wave reaches the valve, the fluid in the whole length of the pipe will be under the pressure $P(\\tau)=P_0+\\rho_0 g h=P_h$ as given in Eq.

        "problem": "We intend to study the motion of a small magnetic dipole in the vicinity of a conducting thin film. In the problem text, the terms dipole and monopole are to be regarded, respectively, as synonymous with magnetic dipole and magnetic monopole.\nA dipole consisting of a spherical permanent magnet with a uniform magnetization $\\vec{M}$ (magnetic dipole moment per unit volume) and a uniform mass density $\\rho_0$ may be treated as a point-like object when its radius $R$ is small. Such a dipole representation is good for describing the magnetic field that the dipole produces everywhere outside of its sphere. The representation is also a good approximation for the force acting on the dipole from an applied magnetic field, whenever distances of field sources from the dipole are much larger than $R$.\nA point-like dipole can be considered as a pair of monopoles carrying negative and positive magnetic charges $-q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ respectively. The pair has a vanishingly small separation, but possesses a finite magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{m}=q_{\\mathrm{m}} \\vec{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Here $\\overrightarrow{\\delta_{\\mathrm{m}}}$ is the displacement vector from the south monopole $\\left(-q_{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)$ to the north monopole $\\left(+q_m\\right)$. The position of the point-like dipole is chosen to be that of the north monopole.\nThe magnetic field $\\vec{B}_{\\mathrm{mp}}$ from a monopole $q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is assumed to have a Coulombic form, given by\n$$\n\\vec{B}_{\\mathrm{mp}}=\\frac{\\mu_0 q_{\\mathrm{m}}}{4 \\pi r^2} \\hat{r}\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{r}$ is the displacement vector from $q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ to the observation point (or field point), $\\hat{r}$ is the unit vector $\\hat{r}=\\vec{r} / r$, and $\\mu_0$ is the free-space permeability. The force exerted by an applied magnetic field $\\vec{B}^{\\prime}$ on $q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is given by $\\vec{F}=q_{\\mathrm{m}} \\vec{B}^{\\prime}$. It follows, from extending the concept of the monopole field just described in Eq.(1), that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ from a point-dipole is derivable from a scalar potential $\\Phi$, given by the form $\\vec{B}=-\\vec{\\nabla} \\Phi$. The scalar potential $\\Phi$ is also called the magnetic potential.\nThe conducting thin film is uniform with thickness $d$ in the $z$ direction (###img_1###). It extends horizontally in $x$ and $y$ directions to infinity and its upper surface is located at a distance $h$ from either a point monopole or a dipole. We consider only the case $h \\gg d$. This allows us to take the electric current density induced in the film to be independent of $z$. We also assume that the displacement current effect to be negligible. The problem is divided into three parts. The system consists of a monopole and a thin film, while in Parts B and C, a moving dipole and a thin film.\nWe choose the $z=0$ plane to coincide with the upper surface of the thin film. The vector $\\vec{\\rho}=x \\hat{x}+y \\hat{y}=\\rho \\hat{\\rho}$ denotes the in-plane position vector. Part A. Sudden appearance of a magnetic monopole: initial response and subsequent time evolution of the response in the thin film ( 3.0 points)\nWe first focus on the initial response of the conducting thin film when at time $t=0$ a north monopole $q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ appears suddenly at the position $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{mp}}=h \\hat{z}(h>0)$, as is shown in ###img_1###. The monopole remains stationary in all later times $(t>0)$.\nOur interest here is the initial total magnetic field $\\vec{B}(\\vec{\\rho}, z)$ in regions $z \\geq 0$ and $z \\leq-d$, and the induced electric current density in the thin film. The total magnetic field $\\vec{B}=\\vec{B}_{\\mathrm{mp}}+\\vec{B}^{\\prime}$, where magnetic fields $\\vec{B}_{\\mathrm{mp}}$ and $\\vec{B}^{\\prime}$ are, respectively, due to the monopole and the induced current in the thin film. The initial $\\vec{B}(\\vec{\\rho}, z)$ we refer to is at the time $t_0$, which falls within the interval $h / c \\leq t_0 \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Here $\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a time constant characterizing the subsequent response of the thin film, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. In this problem, we take the limit $h / c \\rightarrow 0$ and hence let $t_0=0$.\nThe calculation of the initial total magnetic field $\\vec{B}(\\vec{\\rho}, z)$ (at $t_0=0$ ) is facilitated by introducing an image monopole. For $\\vec{B}(\\vec{\\rho}, z)$ in the region $z \\geq 0$, the image monopole has a magnetic charge $q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and is located at $z=-h$. On the other hand, for $\\vec{B}(\\vec{\\rho}, z)$ in the region $z \\leq-d$, the image monopole has a magnetic charge $-q_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and is located at $z=h$. Obtain the initial total magnetic field $\\vec{B}(\\vec{\\rho}, z)$ in $z \\geq 0$ at $t_0=0$.",

        "solution": "If the temperature profile follows the dashed line the droplet will completely melt and the heat transferred from the atmosphere will heat it up. Since the latent heat of melting is much bigger than the specific heat of water times some degrees of temperature variation the temperature of the liquid droplet will closely follow the temperature of the atmosphere eventually. Its temperature at ground level should therefore be close to $8{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.  For a better estimate let us introduce a new coordinate $x$ whose origin is at the height, where the droplet is completely molten (somewhat higher than $\\left.h_{\\mathrm{B}}\\right)$, and which is oriented downwards.

For the difference $\\Delta T=T-T_{\\mathrm{d}}$ between the atmospheric temperature and the droplet temperature we have: $ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\Delta T}{\\mathrm{~d} x}=b-\\frac{\\mathrm{d} T_{\\mathrm{d}}}{\\mathrm{d} x}=b-\\frac{\\kappa}{m c_{\\mathrm{water}} v} \\Delta T . $  This differential equation is solved by $ \\Delta T=b x_0+\\text { const } \\cdot \\exp \\left(-x / x_0\\right), $ where $x_0=m c_{\\text {water }} v / \\kappa$. From equation (2) we find that $\\frac{m v}{\\kappa}=\\frac{A}{L}$ such that $x_0=\\frac{c_{\\text {water }}}{L} A \\approx 0.063 \\mathrm{~km}$. Therefore the exponential factor in the above equation is negligible at ground level (the constant is close to $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) and we arrive at a temperature difference between the droplet temperature and the atmospheric temperature at ground level of $ \\Delta T \\approx 0.13^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, \\quad \\text { and therefore } \\quad T_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 7.9^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} \\text {. } $ Another phenomenon, which effectively shifts atmosphere temperature as it is \"felt\" by the droplet is due to viscous dissipation.

None of these forces perform mechanical work on the ball, so the total kinetic energy of the ball is conserved. Due to the condition of pure rolling, the speed of the center of the ball $v$ is proportional to the angular speed $\\omega$ of the rolling motion, i.e. the total kinetic energy can be expressed in terms of $v^2$. As a result, the speed of the center of the ball remains constant, but the direction of velocity may change.  The net Lorentz force acting on the ball can be expressed with the help of the velocity of the center of the ball $\\vec{v}$ : $ \\vec{F}_L=Q \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}, $ which can be proven by summing up the magnetic forces acting on the small pieces of the ball.  Proof 1. Let us denote the charge of the $i$ th small piece by $\\Delta Q_i$, the position vector directed from the center of the ball to the small piece by $\\vec{x}_i$. The velocity of this small piece is given by $ \\vec{v}_i=\\vec{v}+\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{x}_i $ so the net Lorentz force can be written as $ \\vec{F}_L=\\sum_i \\Delta Q_i \\vec{v}_i \\times \\vec{B}=\\sum_i \\Delta Q_i \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}+\\sum_i \\Delta Q_i\\left(\\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{x}_i\\right) \\times \\vec{B} . $  The second sum gives zero, because terms containing $\\vec{x}_i$ and $-\\vec{x}_i$ cancel each other pairwise. From the first sum $\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}$ can be taken out, so at the end the net force is the same as the Lorentz force acting on a point charge moving with the velocity of center of mass  The speed of the center of the ball does not change, i.e. the net force (which is horizontal) should be perpendicular to the velocity $\\vec{v}$ of the center. Since the Lorentz force is always perpendicular to $\\vec{v}$, so should be the static frictional force $\\vec{F}$, as well. The magnitude of $\\vec{F}$ cannot depend on the position, only on the speed of the ball, so $|\\vec{F}|$ must remain constant during the motion. As a result, the net force (i.e. the acceleration of the center of the ball) is constant in magnitude, so the ball's center will perform a uniform circular motion with speed $|\\vec{v}|=v_0$ (see the ###img_1###). Now we can write down the equation of motion of the ball. The acceleration of the center of mass is horizontal, which is caused by the static frictional force and the net Lorentz force, so with the help of equation (1) Newton's 2nd law in the radial direction can be written as $ Q v B-F=m r \\Omega^2, $ where $r$ is the radius of the circular trajectory of the center of mass and $\\Omega$ is the angular speed of the circular motion. We can obtain a relationship between the two angular speeds from the condition of pure rolling: $ v_0=R \\omega=r \\Omega . $  The magnetic field also exerts a net torque on the charged ball. The torque is given by $ \\vec{\\tau}_L=\\frac{Q}{2 m} \\vec{L} \\times \\vec{B}, $ where $\\vec{L}$ is the angular momentum of the ball with respect to the center.",

        "solution": "To begin with, let us notice that the envelope of the trajectories of balls thrown from the origin with the same launching speed $v$ at different launching angles is a parabola (1 pt), and the focus of the parabola is the launching point (1 pt).  This fact can be proved as follows (the proof is not required from the contestants). The trajectory of the ball can be expressed parametrically as $x=v \\cos \\alpha t, y=v \\sin \\alpha t-\\frac{1}{2} g t^2$. Upon eliminating $t$ we obtain $ y=x \\tan \\alpha-\\frac{g}{2 v^2} x^2\\left(1+\\tan ^2 \\alpha\\right) . $  We can consider this as an equation for finding the angle $\\alpha$ to reach the point $(x, y)$ : $ g x^2 \\tan ^2 \\alpha-2 v^2 x \\tan \\alpha+2 v^2 y+g x^2=0 . $  The points at the envelope separate the points for which the solution to this equation does exist from the points for which the solution does not exist, hence for the envelope points the discriminant of the equation must be zero, $ v^4 x^2=g x^2\\left(2 v^2 y+g x^2\\right) \\Rightarrow y=\\frac{v^2}{2 g}-\\frac{g x^2}{2 v^2} . $  What we got is a parabola, and the position of the focus can be deduced from this formula. Alternatively, the position of the focus can be deduced from the fact that light rays parallel to the axis of a parabola converge after reflection from the parabolic shape into its focus. Indeed, the touching point of the envelope with a trajectory of a ball launched at $\\alpha=45^{\\circ}$ must lie at $y=0$ as this launching angle is known to provide the longest flight distance. Hence, the envelope and the $x$-axis meet at $45^{\\circ}$, so that a vertical beam hitting the envelope at $y=0$ is reflected by the envelope into a horizontal line. The focus must lie on that reflected beam, i.e. at $y=0$.  The parabolic trajectory of each water parcel must touch the envelope (1 pts). Using the knowledge that the launching angles of the water parcels were never less than $45^{\\circ}$, we conclude that the touching point must lie at $y \\geq 0$ (1 pt). This can be seen from the fact that a parcel launched at $45^{\\circ}$ will meet the envelope at $y=0$, and increasing the launching angle will raise the touching point.  There are many ways of proving it more rigorously. For instance, one can use the fact (proved below) that the launching velocity and the tangent to the envelope at the point $A$ where the trajectory and the envelope meet are perpendicular to each other: with $\\alpha+\\beta=90^{\\circ}$ ( $\\beta$ denotes the angle between the tangent and the horizon) we conclude that increasing $\\alpha$ means decreasing $\\beta$, hence raising $A$. To prove that $\\alpha+\\beta=90^{\\circ}$, let a vertically up-directed beam be reflected from the trajectory at $A$ : it will go through the focus of the trajectory which means that if we continue it through the focus and let it be reflected a second time from the same trajectory, it will propagate vertically down. The trajectory and the envelope are tangent at $A$, so the first reflection was also a reflection from the envelope and the reflected beam must go through the focus of the envelope, i.e. the launching point $O$. Point $O$ lies on the trajectory, so the second reflection point must be $O$. As a result of the two reflections, the beam was diverted by $180^{\\circ}$ which means that the double sum of the incidence angles must have been $180^{\\circ}$, and hence $2 \\alpha+2 \\beta=180^{\\circ}$.  The water parcels close to the origin are clearly yet to reach the envelope, and those parcels below the ground level have clearly passed the point where they touched the envelope. Since the parcels form a continuous curve, there must be at least one point $P$ which is exactly at the envelope 1 pts).  There are two ways of finding the position of the point $P$. The first approach is as follows. Notice that at $P$, the water curve is tangent to the envelope. Hence, vertical line drawn through $P$ will be reflected by the water curve so that it will go through the focus $O$. So, we need to find by trial and error such a point $P$ on the upper segment of the water curve that the line $O P$ and a vertical line drawn through $P$ will form equal angles with the water curve at $P$ (finding the position of $P$ with a reasonable accuracy: see the ###img_1###. Alternatively, we can use the fact that for any point on a parabola, its distance from the focus plus its distance from a horizontal line is constant. So, for an arbitrary point $Q=(x, y)$ on the envelope, $y+\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=2 H$, where $H$ is a constant, and for any point beneath it, $y+$ $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}<2 H$. Hence, among all the points at the water curve, the point $P$ has the largest value of $y+\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ (2 pts). We can evaluate $y+\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ for a series of points at the water curve and find the one with the largest value (finding the position of $P$ with a reasonable accuracy: ###img_1###. Once we have found the point $P$, we can easily find the height of the topmost point of the envelope due to the equality $y+\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=2 H_P$ : for the topmost point, $x=0$ so that its $y$-coordinate $2 y=2 H_P$, hence $y=H_P$; The topmost point of the envelope would be reached by a water parcel launched vertically, so $v^2=2 g H_P$, and $v=\\sqrt{2 g H_P}$ (1 pt). From the figure we can find $2 H_P=$ $\\left(3.3+\\sqrt{10.8^2+3.3^2}\\right) \\mathrm{m} \\approx 14.6 \\mathrm{~m}$ so that $v \\approx 12 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}(\\mathbf{1} \\mathbf{~ p t})$.",

        "solution": " According to Newton's third law, the force acting on the solenoid is equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the force acting on the loop. The latter can be obtained from Lorentz's law by summation of infinitesimal forces $\\vec{F}=J \\Delta \\vec{l} \\times \\vec{B}$ acting on the individual loop elements $\\Delta \\vec{l}$, where $J=\\mathcal{E} / R$ is the current in the loop.  Since the solenoid is long and thin, the magnetic field lines inside it are directed in $+z$ direction, and escape only from the immediate vicinity of its ends. The magnetic field outside the solenoid is vortex-free and sourcefree. The same requirements are satisfied by the electric field in empty space. Hence, the magnetic field outside the solenoid can be well approximated by a field created by two magnetic poles: a North pole residing close to point $O_1$ and a South pole located near to $O_2$. The flux $\\Phi$ emerging from the North pole (and the flux entering the South pole) is the same as the flux passing through the solenoid's cross-section: $ \\Phi=B_{\\text {in }} A=\\mu_0 \\frac{N I}{\\ell} A . $  When the endpoint $O_1$ of the solenoid is placed in the loop centre $O$, the magnetic field of the other end $\\left(\\mathrm{O}_2\\right)$ near the loop is negligible. The field created by the North pole located at $O_1$ is pointing radially outwards, and its magnitude at the loop circumference is (from spherical symmetry): $ B(r)=\\frac{\\Phi}{4 \\pi r^2}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{N I A}{\\ell r^2} . $  Note. it is also correct to assume that the flux from the $B$-field (which carries a factor of $1 / 2$ compared to the field above at the end of the solenoid is uniformly distributed over hemisphere.  The forces acting on all elements of the loop (and also the net force) point in the $-z$ direction, which can be expected also from the same current directions (i.e. the loop and the solenoid attract each other). Hence, the reaction force acting on the solenoid points in the $+z$ direction, and its magnitude is given by: $ F_1=\\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R} \\cdot 2 \\pi r \\cdot \\frac{\\mu_0}{4 \\pi} \\frac{N I A}{\\ell r^2}=\\frac{\\mu_0 N I A \\mathcal{E}}{2 \\ell R r} . $  When the endpoint $O_2$ is located at the centre of the loop, the magnetic field produced by the South pole exerts a force on the loop. Since this field is directed radially inward, the force acting on the solenoid is the same in magnitude, but opposite in direction $(-z)$ as the force calculated above: $ \\vec{F}_2=-\\vec{F}_1 . $",

        "solution": "When you look at the photo of the lens and/or the graph provided, four regions with different brightness levels can be distinguished. The brightest region represents the magnified image of the blur spot created by the lamp through the lens. The blur spot is created because the distance from the lens to the white sheet beneath it is slightly larger than the focal distance; as we can see from the graph, the blur spot is of almost constant brightness (a flat plateau at $\\log _{10} I=4.4$ ), so we can say that the entire luminous flux falling from the lamp onto the lens is distributed evenly over the blur spot. Note that the blur spot has no sharp edges, though, as you would expect from in such case. This is because the image of this bright disc is situated between the lens and the camera, and is at a fairly big distance away from the plane which is sharp at the image sensor (as seen from the photo, the camera is focused onto the lens). Because of that, the enlarged image of the blur spot has blurred edges in the photo (at the blurred edges, $\\log _{10} I$ varies from 3.4 to 4.4). The second-brightest region (with $\\log _{10} I=3.4$ ) represents the scattered light from the brightest region: in that region, we are still looking through the lens, and see the area next to the bright blur spot on the sheet. Ideally, its should be darker than the sheet seen in those places where it is not obstructed by the lens, because the lens is shading the light from the lamp. However, the glass elements of this big lens are non-ideal (and there are many glass elements inside the lens!), so the light from the lamp and the bright blur spot is scattered towards the camera giving rise to an increased apparent brightness. In the area where we see the blur spot, this light is insignificant (much weaker than the light from the blur spot), but not so in this dark area: here, the scatteredfrom-the-glass-surfaces dominates heavily over the light coming from the paper sheet. As a matter of fact, this fact could be used to improve the accuracy of the calculations: we could subtract the contribution of the scattered light $\\left(10^{3.4}\\right)$ from the total intensity of the light at the brightest spot $\\left(10^{4.4}\\right)$ to obtain the contribution coming from the blur spot on the sheet. The darkest regions (with $\\log _{10} I<1.75$ ) represent the interior black painting of the lens seen through the big front glass element of the lens, which absorbs most of the incident light, and the region with $x>420$ and $\\log _{10} I=1.95$ represents the white sheet illuminated by the lamp. The ratio between the measured light intensity of the brightest region and that of the region with $x>420$ can be utilized to find the distance of the sheet (the blur spot) from the lens to the paper sheet $d_0$, see below. From the data given in the problem text we know that $L \\gg f$; from the photo of the lens, it is also clear that $d_0$ is of the same order of magnitude as $f$. Because of that, the illuminance $E$ (luminous flux per unit area) near the lens can be assumed to be the same as at the paper sheet, The luminous flux per solid angle and unit area of a lightscattering (or radiating) surface is called the luminance $\\mathscr{L}$; since all these directions under which the scattered light enters the lens aperture are close to the surface normal, we may assume the luminance of the paper sheet to be constant over all these directions. With the small angle approximation, the light intensity $I$ (illuminance, luminous flux $\\Phi$ per unit area) at the camera sensor is proportional to $\\mathscr{L}$ (see Explanation 1).  The luminance of the blur spot on the sheet $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ is $1 / k$ larger than the luminance $\\mathscr{L}_s$ of the paper sheet, where $k$ equals the ratio between the area of the bright dot (the blur spot) on the paper sheet and the area of the lens, because all the light received by the lens is \"compressed\" into the tiny blur spot.  Small angle approximation is also used to show that luminance of the image of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_I$ equals to the luminance of the blur spot $\\mathscr{L}_{B S}$ (see Explanation 2). Therefore, the light intensity at the sensor cells corresponding to the brightest area (where we see the image of the blur spot) $I_I=I_s / k$, where $I_s$ stands for the intensity at the cells corresponding to unobscured paper sheet. So, from the graph, we can deduce the value of $k$, and knowing $k$ we can calculate $d_0$. Let the distance along the axis between the image of the bright region through the lens and the lens itself be denoted as $d_S$; according to the Newton's lens formula, $\\left(d_S-f\\right)\\left(d_0-f\\right)=$ $f^2$. Hence, $ d_S=f+\\frac{f^2}{d_0-f}=\\frac{d_0 f}{\\left(d_0-f\\right)} $ can be also determined. Hypothesize that $d_0-f \\ll f$. Let us calculate the diameter of the image of the blur spot $ D_I=\\frac{D_{B S} d_S}{d_0}=\\frac{D_{B S} f}{d_0-f}, $ where the diameter of the blur spot on the sheet $ D_{B S}=\\frac{D\\left(d_0-f-s\\right)}{f+s} \\approx \\frac{D\\left(d_0-f-s\\right)}{f}, $ and $s$ denotes the distance of the image of the point source from the focal plane. Using Newton's lens formula, $s=f^2 /\\left(L-f-d_0\\right) \\approx f^2 / L$, This leads us to $ D_{B S} \\approx D\\left(\\frac{d_0-f}{f}-\\frac{f}{L}\\right) $ and therefore $ D_I \\approx D\\left[1-\\frac{f^2}{L\\left(d_0-f\\right)}\\right] $ This means that as seen from the position of the camera, the angular size of the image of the blur spot $\\theta_{B S}=$ $D_I /\\left(L-d_S\\right)$ equals to the angular size of the lens aperture $\\theta_L=D / L$. This fact is easily confirmed from the photo and is an important observation for two reasons. First, it means that based on the angular diameter of the image of the blur spot on the photo, it is impossible to figure out the distance $d_0$ (and hence, $d_S$ ). Second, it allows us to measure instead of the angular distance $\\theta$ between the centre of the lens and the centre of the image of the blur spot (as seen from the position of the cameraline), the respective distance between the edges of the respective circles. Equality of these two angular sizes is also easily seen from the geometric construction, see the ###img_1###. Ineed, consider blue lines $S A G$ and $S B F$ which arrive from the lamp $S$ to the edges of the blur spot. Image of point $F$, denoted by $J$, is now easily found as the intersection point of the ray $S B F$ with the ray $F O$ (passing through the centre of the lens); image $H$ of the other edge of the blur spot is found in the same way. From this construction, it becomes clear that the angular size of the image of the blur spot and the lens, as seen from the camera, are exactly equal, without any approximation. Due to the smallness of the distance $h$, these angular sizes remain almost constant when the observation point is moved from $S$ to $C$.  Given the images are approximately circular, the area ratio $k$ equals $\\left(D_{B S} / D\\right)^2$, or $ \\pm \\sqrt{k}=\\frac{1}{f}\\left(d_0-\\frac{L f}{L-f}\\right)=\\frac{d_0}{f}-\\frac{L}{L-f} . $  In the above equation, the \\pm sign represents the two cases where the paper sheet is behind or in front of the image of the lamp. From the graph, the ratio between the intensity of the brightest region and the dark region with $x>420$ is $10^{4.4-1.95} \\approx 282$, which equals $1 / k$. Then, $d_0 / f$ can be found to be $\\pm \\sqrt{k}+1+f / L$, which gives two solutions $d_0 / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_0 / f \\approx 0.95$. According to the experimental settings given in the problem text, $d_0$ is greater than $f$, and thus we obtain $d_0 / f \\approx 1.07$ and $d_S \\approx 15.03 f \\approx 83 \\mathrm{~cm}$. This also verifies the hypothesis that $d_0-f \\ll f$.  The centre of the image of the blur spot is positioned at the height $h^{\\prime}=h \\frac{d_S}{L}$ above the direction to the centre of the lens (this expression from similarity of the triangles $O Q P$ and $O C S$ ) which means that $\\theta=h^{\\prime} /\\left(L-d_S\\right)$; meanwhile, the angular diameter of the lens $\\theta_L=D / L$. Therefore, $ \\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_L}=\\frac{h d_S}{D\\left(L-d_S\\right)} . $  The ratio of the angular distances is easily measured from the ###img_2### as the ratio of the width $d_{c r}$ of the crescent-shaped second-brightest region to the diameter of the lense's aperture $D^{\\prime}$ : $ h=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\frac{D\\left(L-d_S\\right)}{d_S} . $ Based on the graph, $d_{c r} \\approx 90$ pixels (midpoint of the blurry edge is around $x \\approx 120 \\mathrm{px}$, and the left edge of the aperture (in the graph) is at $x \\approx 30 \\mathrm{px}$; the right edge of the lens aperture is at $x \\approx 240 \\mathrm{px}$ corresponding to $D^{\\prime}=210 \\mathrm{px}$ and yielding $h \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm}$.  Remark 1. In order to obtain the final answer with a reasonably good accuracy, it is not strictly speaking necessary to show that the apparent angular diameters of the lens and of the image of the blur spot are equal. All the other calculations remain the same, just one needs to match a circle with the circular segment of the visible edge of the blur spot, and measure directly $h^{\\prime}$, the distance between the centre of the lens and the centre of the blur spot, together with the diameter of the lens aperture $D^{\\prime}$ (see the small ###img_1###).  Remark 2. The width of the crescent-shaped secondbrightest area can be also measured from the photo of the lens with the required accuracy; however, measuring in pixels from the graph is more accurate.  Explanation 1: Consider a small light source of luminance $\\mathcal{L}$ and surface area $S$ at a large distance $\\uparrow$ from the camera. The illuminance (the luminous flux per unit area) at the position of the camera is proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$ and so is the total luminous flux received by the whole sensor. Meanwhile, all this light energy is focused onto a small area $S^{\\prime}$ on the sensor - onto the image of the light source, and this area is also proportional to $\\uparrow^{-2}$. Therefore, the illuminance $I$ at the position of those sensor pixels which are covered by the image is independent of the distance $\\uparrow$.  Explanation 2: Consider a very narrow cone of light of solid angle $\\omega$, starting from a very small area $S$ at the blur spot in a direction close to the surface normal, and carrying a total luminous flux $\\Phi$. Since the cone is narrow, this light beam is entirely caught by the lens at distance $d_0$, and focused onto the image of surface area $S^{\\prime}=S\\left(d_S / d_0\\right)^2$ at distance $d_S$ from the lens. The light rays of this beam traverse the focus and form another light cone of solid angle $\\omega^{\\prime}$ departing from the image. It is easy to see from similar triangles that $\\omega / \\omega^{\\prime}=\\left(d_S / d_0\\right)^2$. Then, Remark 3: After having derived Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 and calculated $d_0$, the geometrical optics aspect can also be tackled by considering the image of the camera through the lens. The region bounded by the darkest ring in the image represents the area on the paper sheet that is observable by the camera through the lens. This area can be approximated by a circular spot with diameter $d$ (represented by $D^{\\prime}$ in the graph) depending negligibly on the size of the lens of the camera. Given small angles and that the lamp and the camera have equal distances to the lens, the bright spot on the paper sheet also has a diameter of $d$, which means $d=D \\sqrt{k}$. The angular distance between the lamp and the camera as seen from the center of the lens is $h /\\left(L-d_0\\right)$, and the luminance of the image $\\mathcal{L}_I=\\Phi /\\left(S^{\\prime} \\omega^{\\prime}\\right)=\\Phi /(S \\omega)$, i.e. equal to the luminance of the blur spot. therefore, the distances between the two spots' centers, and also thus their boundaries (represented by $d_{c r}$ in the graph), on the paper sheet are $d_0 h /\\left(L-d_0\\right)$. We then obtain an equivalent equation to that above: $ \\frac{d_0 h /\\left(L-d_0\\right)}{D \\sqrt{k}}=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} \\Leftrightarrow h=\\frac{d_{c r}}{D^{\\prime}} D \\sqrt{k} \\frac{L-d_0}{d_0} \\approx 80 \\mathrm{~mm} . $  It should be noted that, compared to the original analysis, the deviation in this calculation caused by $f / L$ (in finding $d_0$ and $d_S$ ) on the final result reduces drastically (from approximately $20 \\%$ down to approximately $1 \\%$ ). Even if $d_0 \\approx f$ is assumed, the result is only deviated by approximately $7 \\%$.",

        "solution": "###img_1### shows the cylinder and the loop from three different angles; $P$ denotes the pulled point of the loop, while $O$ is the top point of the thread. Imagine that the side of the cylinder is cut along the generatrix $A B$ passing through point $P$, and then the side (including the loop) is unfolded as shown in ###img_2###. In this figure points $A$ and $A^{\\prime}, B$ and $B^{\\prime}, P$ and $P^{\\prime}$ are equivalent, respectively. Let us introduce a Cartesian coordinate system on this unfolded plane so that point $O$ is the origin, axis $z$ is parallel with the axis of cylinder and directed downwards, axis $x$ is perpendicular to $z$ (i.e. horizontal). Consider the forces acting on a small piece of the thread (with horizontal projection $\\Delta x$ ) indicated with red line in both figures. These are the tensions at both ends of the small piece exerted by neighbouring parts of the thread, the normal force $\\Delta N$ and the friction force $\\Delta f$ exerted by the cylinder. On the verge of slipping, the direction of $\\Delta f$ is parallel to the $z$-axis. Since the small piece of thread is in equilibrium, the $x$-component of the tension is the same everywhere: $ T_x=\\text { const. } $  The normal force $\\Delta N$ can be determined by looking at the top view of the loop in ###img_1###. The polar angle corresponding to small piece of thread is $\\Delta \\varphi=\\Delta x / R$, so the force balance in the radial direction can be written as $ 2 T_x \\underbrace{\\sin \\frac{\\Delta \\varphi}{2}}_{\\approx \\Delta \\varphi / 2}-\\Delta N=0 \\rightarrow \\Delta N=T_x \\frac{\\Delta x}{R} . $ The frictional force on the verge of slipping is given by $ \\Delta f=\\mu \\Delta N . $  Thus, the force balance on the small piece of thread in the $z$ direction (see ###img_2###): $ \\left.T_x \\frac{\\mathrm{d} z}{\\mathrm{~d} x}\\right|_{x+\\Delta x}-\\left.T_x \\frac{\\mathrm{d} z}{\\mathrm{~d} x}\\right|_x-\\Delta f=0, $ where we expressed the $z$-component of the tension forces with $T_x$ and the tangent $\\mathrm{d} z / \\mathrm{d} x$. Using the three equations above and taking the limit $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$, we get the differential equation $ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 z}{\\mathrm{~d} x^2}=\\frac{\\mu}{R}, $ where we used the fact that $T_x \\neq 0$. By direct integration and taking into account the boundary conditions $z(0)=0$ and $z^{\\prime}(0)=0$ we get $ z(x)=\\frac{\\mu}{2 R} x^2, $ so the shape of the thread on the unfolded side surface (###img_2###) can be described by a parabola. The thread needs to span over the entire cylinder, so its length can be calculated as $ L_0=\\int_{-\\pi R}^{\\pi R} \\sqrt{\\mathrm{d} x^2+\\mathrm{d} z^2}=2 \\int_0^{\\pi R} \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} z}{\\mathrm{~d} x}\\right)^2} \\mathrm{~d} x . $  Substituting the $z(x)$ function we get: $ L_0=2 \\int_0^{\\pi R} \\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{\\mu x}{R}\\right)^2} \\mathrm{~d} x=\\left(\\frac{R}{\\mu}\\right) 2 \\int_0^{\\pi \\mu} \\sqrt{1+\\xi^2} \\mathrm{~d} \\xi $ where we introduced the notation $\\xi=\\mu x / R$. Using the integral given in the text of the problem: $ L_0=\\pi R \\sqrt{1+(\\pi \\mu)^2}+\\frac{R}{\\mu} \\operatorname{arcsinh}(\\pi \\mu) . $  If the length of the thread is shorter than the length calculated here, then there is no solution satisfying the thread length constraint, i.e. the thread cannot slip.  Note. In the limit $\\mu \\rightarrow 0$ the loop slips even if $L=2 \\pi R$, which should be reproduced by our final formula. Using the relation for the inverse hyperbolic function given in the problem text, then expanding the logarithm in Taylor series in linear order around 0 we get: $ \\operatorname{arcsinh} x \\equiv \\ln \\left(x+\\sqrt{1+x^2}\\right) \\approx \\ln (x+1) \\approx x, $ so for small values of $\\mu$ we get $ L_0 \\approx \\pi R+\\frac{R}{\\mu}(\\pi \\mu)=2 \\pi R . $",

Similarly, starting from the same relation we can prove that the angle between $O B$ and $O C$, and $O C$ and $O A$ are all 120 degrees. There is one corner case that we should also be concerned with. The formula (1.2) is valid as long as $d \\neq 0$, i.e. if the point $O$ is not the same as $A, B$, or $C$. We need to make sure that if $O$ is the same as $A, B$, or $C$, then it is not the network of minimal length. Let's assume without loss of generality that $O=A$.

Once again, since each intersection has at least three edges entering it (except for the case where an intersection point agrees with a vertex which we will once again check separately), the minimal length network can have at most 2 intersection points, each with 3 edges entering it. We will call these two intersection points $O_1$ and $O_2$. Translating $O_1$ or $O_2$ independently by any infinitesimal vectors $\\vec{\\delta}_1$ or $\\vec{\\delta}_2$, respectively, should not decrease the distance. Therefore, we can use the variation formula (1.3), independently for the points $O_1$ and $O_2$. Therefore the angles between all the edges entering $O_1$ and $\\mathrm{O}_2$, respectively, are all equal to 120 degrees. This leads to one of the two configuration shown in figure 1 , both of which have paths of equal length.\nThe length of this configuration is:\n$$\nD=4\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\frac{L}{2}\\right)+\\left(L-2 \\frac{L}{2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)=L(1+\\sqrt{3})=L \\cdot 2.732 \\ldots\n$$\nwhere the term in the first parenthesis gives the length of the the edges connecting $O_{1,2}$ to the closest vertex of the square and the term in the second parenthesis is the length of the edge connecting $\\mathrm{O}_1$ to $\\mathrm{O}_2$. ###img_1### Finally, we also need to make sure that the configurations that we just discussed are indeed those with the shortest path, not only amongst those that have two intersections. First, we note that $1+\\sqrt{3}<2 \\sqrt{2}$ and, therefore, the two intersection configuration has a shorter length than the one intersection configuration. We also need to make sure that the degenerate configurations where the intersection points are the same as two of the vertices of the square is longer than the two intersection configuration. The former configuration has length $3 L>L(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\nTherefore, the configurations in figure 1 are those of shortest overall length. Note that each of the two configurations do not obey all the symmetries of the square: for instance, 90 degrees rotations around the center of the square maps one configuration to the other, but not to itself. This is in contrast to the example in part c) where all the symmetry transformations leave the configuration invariant. Therefore, as hinted at in the problem's introduction, this is a basic example of spontaneous symmetry breaking in which the minimal configuration is not fully symmetric. ###img_1###: Figure 1: Minimum length configuration for the square.",

An important point to generalizing Steiner's observation regarding the two cities placed on the Equator, is that the choice of North and South pole is arbitrary for a homogeneous sphere. Therefore, with a different choice of North and South pole, any two points $A$ and $B$ on the sphere can be placed on the same equator. This is called the \"great circle\" that passes through $A$ and $B$.",

Because of that, he has to take Earth's curvature into account when designing the highway network. Assume that Earth is a perfect sphere with radius $R$ with a homogenous surface that has no obstacles. To connect only two cities located on Earth's equator, he has found that the minimal path between the two also follows the equator. Using this fact, help Mr. Steiner design the following two highway networks: Hint: Given two points ( 1 and 2 ) on the sphere, whose normal vectors to the surface of the sphere are given by $\\overrightarrow{n_1}$ and $\\overrightarrow{n_2}$ then the distance between the two points is given by\n$$\nd=R \\theta\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\overrightarrow{n_1}$ and $\\overrightarrow{n_2}$, given by\n$$\n\\cos \\theta=\\overrightarrow{n_1} \\overrightarrow{n_2}\n$$\n\nUse this to show that the unit vector tangent to the sphere at point 1, pointing from 1 to 2 , can be expressed as\n$$\n\\overrightarrow{e_{12}}=-\\frac{\\overrightarrow{n_1} \\overrightarrow{n_2}}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\overrightarrow{n_1} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{n_2}\\right)^2}} \\overrightarrow{n_1}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\overrightarrow{n_1} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{n_2}\\right)^2}} \\overrightarrow{n_2}\n$$\nas long as the vectors $\\overrightarrow{n_1}$ and $\\overrightarrow{n_2}$ are not opposite to each other (i.e. the points are exactly on opposite sides of the sphere).

Let's translate the point $O$ by an infinitesimal vector $\\vec{\\delta}$ to the point $O^{\\prime}$. The normal vector at $O^{\\prime}$ is $\\vec{n}_{O^{\\prime}}=\\vec{n}_O+\\vec{\\delta}^2{ }^2$ the change in distance between $O$ and one of the vertices (let's say $A$ ) is$\\delta d_{O A}=R\\left[\\arccos \\left(\\vec{n}_A \\cdot \\vec{n}_O+\\vec{n}_A \\cdot \\vec{\\delta}\\right)-\\arccos \\left(\\vec{n}_A \\cdot \\vec{n}_O\\right)\\right]=-R \\frac{\\vec{n}_A \\cdot \\vec{\\delta}}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\vec{n}_A \\cdot \\vec{n}_O\\right)^2}} .$ Therefore, the variation of the overall distance of the network under an infinitesimal translation of $O$ is$\\delta D=\\delta d_{O A}+\\delta d_{O B}+\\delta d_{O C}=-R \\vec{\\delta} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\vec{n}_A}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\vec{n}_A \\cdot \\vec{n}_O\\right)^2}}+\\frac{\\vec{n}_A}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\vec{n}_C \\cdot \\vec{n}_O\\right)^2}}+\\frac{\\vec{n}_C}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\vec{n}_C \\cdot \\vec{n}_O\\right)^2}}\\right) .$ This does not determine the angles between the edges just yet. To do that, we can express the inner product above in terms of the tangent vectors $\\vec{e}_{O A}, \\vec{e}_{O B}$, and $\\vec{e}_{O C}$ pointing from $O$ to each vertex of the triangle, $A, B$ or $C$ respectively. To find $\\vec{e}_{O A}$, we first observe that this vector is coplanar with $\\vec{n}_O$ and $\\vec{n}_A$. Therefore, as long as $O$ and $A$ are not at opposite poles of the sphere or are identical to each other, than $\\vec{e}_{O A}$ can be expressed as a liner combination of $\\vec{n}_O$ and $\\vec{n}_A$. Therefore, we need to find $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that$\\vec{e}_{O A}=\\alpha \\vec{n}_O+\\beta \\vec{n}_A, \\quad \\vec{e}_{O A} \\cdot \\vec{n}_O=0, \\quad \\vec{e}_{O A} \\cdot \\vec{e}_{O A}=1,$which implies$\\alpha+\\beta \\vec{n}_A \\cdot \\vec{n}_O=0, \\quad \\alpha^2+\\beta^2+2 \\alpha \\beta \\vec{n}_O \\cdot \\vec{n}_A=1 .$ The solutions to this system of equation yields$\\vec{e}_{O A}= \\pm\\left(\\frac{\\vec{n}_O \\cdot \\vec{n}_A}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\vec{n}_O \\cdot \\vec{n}_A\\right)^2}} \\vec{n}_O-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\left(\\vec{n}_O \\cdot \\vec{n}_A\\right)^2}} \\vec{n}_A\\right) .$ We obtained two solutions only one of which points from $O$ to $A$ along the shortest path. With a bit of thought one can check that this corresponds to the - solution in (1.14). Using (1.14) we find that (1.11) can be expressed as$\\delta D=R \\vec{\\delta}\\left(\\vec{e}_{O A}+\\vec{e}_{O B}+\\vec{e}_{O C}\\right)$ This is precisely the same formula as the one found on the plane! We will see why this is the case in an intuitive way as part of solution II. Using the same reasoning as in Part 1 we can conclude that the angle between all the edges is again precisely 120 degrees. Finally, as before, we need to check the corner cases in which $O$ coincides with one of the point $A, B$ and $C$. The angle at $A$ is 60 degrees, the angle at $B$ is 90 degrees and the angle at $C$ is also 90 degrees (note that for a triangle on a sphere the sum of the angles is not 180 degrees). Because all these angles are smaller than 120 degrees we conclude, using the same reasoning as in Part 1 , that any of these configurations cannot be a minimum.  Therefore, to summarize, the minimum length configuration is achieved by a network in one intersection, whose edges point along great circles between this intersection point and each vertex of the triangle, and the angle between all vertices is 120 degrees. Note that the vector $\\vec{n}_{O^{\\prime}}$ is still a normal vector to leading order in $\\delta$ since $\\left|\\vec{n}_{O^{\\prime}}\\right|=1+\\vec{n}_O \\cdot \\vec{\\delta}+O\\left(\\delta^2\\right)=1+O\\left(\\delta^2\\right)$, since $\\vec{\\delta}$ and $\\vec{n}_O$ are orthogonal.",

        "problem": "The most popular coffee making device in Italy is the so-called moka pot (###img_1###) and the purpose of this problem is to analyze some of the physical processes and phenomena taking place during the coffee brewing process.\n\nThe moka pot has three independent structural elements, all made of aluminum: the kettle (the lower part of the pot) in which the water is heated; the kettle has a safety pressure valve at its upper part (###img_1### and ###img_2###);\nthe funnel, which contains the ground coffee container (###img_2###). Its tube is submerged into the water but does not touch the base of the kettle. The coffee container has a cylindrical shape with the inner diameter $d=4.3 \\mathrm{~cm}$ and the depth $h=1.4 \\mathrm{~cm}$. The base of the container is a filter (a perforated $\\mathrm{Al}$ disc, as can be seen in ###img_2### and ###img_3###). When the container is filled with coffee, the coffee forms a plug acting as a porous filter for water; the collector (the upper vessel of the pot) in which the water passing the coffee plug is collected (the liquid coffee). At its bottom there is a similar filter as in the funnel (a perforated $\\mathrm{Al}$ plate), which touches the upper surface of the coffee plug (###img_3###). This filter is surrounded by a rubber gasket which seals the air pocket trapped above the water in the kettle, between the funnel and the kettle walls (###img_3### and ###img_4### ). The moka pot is used as follows (###img_2###):\n- water is poured into the kettle (not surpassing the safety valve);\n- the funnel is lowered into the kettle, closing its opening;\n- the funnel's container is loaded with ground coffee;\n- the collector is screwed onto the kettle;\n- the pot is placed on a slow heater.\n\nOne functioning cycle of the moka pot can be divided into two stages:\nA. The rise of the water temperature;\nB. The water transfer from the kettle to the collector, through the funnel. This stage ends with a gurgling sound made by the residual steam during its evacuation from the kettle. A. Stage one: the rise of the water temperature $(4.2 \\mathrm{p})$\n\nDuring this stage, no water flows from the kettle to the collector. This heating process can also be divided into two parts:\na) as its temperature increases from $\\theta_1=17.3^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $\\theta_2=72.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the water rises in the funnel and at $\\theta_2=72.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ the water touches the perforated disc at the bottom of the coffee plug from the funnel;\nb) as its temperature increases from $\\theta_2=72.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to $\\theta_3=99.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the water floods the coffee plug. At $\\theta_3=99.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ the water fills completely the ground coffee container. Some quantities of interest for water (density, pressure of saturated vapors, and dynamic viscosity coefficient) for the above temperatures are given in the adjacent table.\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline$\\theta /{ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ & $\\rho_w / \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m}^3}$ & $p_{s v} / \\mathrm{kPa}$ & $\\eta / 10^{-4} \\mathrm{~Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$ \\\\\n\\hline 17.3 & 999 & 1.98 & 10.7 \\\\\n\\hline 72.0 & 977 & 34.0 & 3.92 \\\\\n\\hline 99.5 & 959 & 99.6 & 2.83 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe useful volume of the kettle (obtained from its total inner volume by subtracting the volume displaced by the walls of the funnel and the volume of the funnel's container) is $V_0=84.2 \\mathrm{ml}$. If this volume of water is poured into the kettle, the water touches the perforated disc of the funnel and there is no air pocket above the water (see ###img_4###). However, the water level in the kettle should be lower than the safety valve. In this problem, the water mass used for making coffee was $m_w=60.0 \\mathrm{~g}$, which satisfies the above restriction. Also, during the coffee brewing process, for the specific data given in this problem, the safety pressure valve does not open.\n\nThe atmospheric pressure when the experimental data were collected was $p_0=96.4 \\mathrm{kPa}$. The air and the water vapors existent above the water in the kettle are considered ideal gases and the thermal dilatation of the pot is neglected throughout this problem. The water is considered permanently in dynamical equilibrium with its vapors because the heating process is a slow one. A. 1 Water vapors $(0.9 \\mathrm{p})$\n\nAbove the water in the kettle, trapped between the wall of the funnel and that of the kettle, there is a fixed amount of air and a variable quantity of saturated water vapors - the so-called \"air pocket\" in ###img_4###. Knowing that the mass of water vaporized during the heating process is negligible compared with the total mass of water, derive an expression for the mass of saturated water vapors $\\left(m_{s v, 2}\\right)$ in the air pocket at the temperature $\\theta_2=72.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and calculate its numerical value.

The hydrodynamic resistance of the filter $\\mathcal{R}_h$, similarly to its counterpart in electricity, depends on the area $S$ of the plug's transversal section, its height $h$, but it also depends on the dynamic viscosity coefficient $\\eta$ of water and on the so-called filtration coefficient, $k$, also known as the permeability of the filter. Knowing that the filtration coefficient has the dimension of an area and that the measurement unit for $\\eta$ in SI is $\\mathrm{Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}$, derive an expression for $\\mathcal{R}_h$, as a function of $S, h, k$ and $\\eta$, using dimensional analysis. Consider any numeric coefficient equal to one.",
